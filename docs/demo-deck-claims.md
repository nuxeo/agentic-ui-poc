# Demo deck — claims ledger

**Rule: no factual claim reaches a slide without a row here.** A row carries the claim, the
first-hand source, and the caveat that must travel with it.

This file exists because the failure mode of a leadership deck is not invention — it is a **true
number quoted without the caveat that makes it mean what the audience thinks it means**. This
programme has shipped that error before, in both directions, and an independent review caught it
every time.

Verified 2026-09-01 against the current branch unless a row says otherwise.

## 1. Part 6 re-verification (Phase A)

`docs/beta-demo-runbook.md` Part 6 lists thirteen things not to demo, dated 2026-08-25. **161
commits** landed since. Every entry re-checked against current code:

| **F1**  | holds                       | `bootstrap-config.ts:42-47` — `AppBrandingConfig` declares `applicationTitle` and `documentTitle`, nothing else. No logo or favicon key exists.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **F2**  | holds                       | `app-shell.component.ts:203` — `return match?.label ?? …branding.applicationTitle`. The route label wins; the brand surfaces only on an unmatched route.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **F3**  | holds                       | `runtime-manifest.ts` declares neither `branding` nor `themes`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **F4**  | holds                       | `applyOverride()` (`extension-slot-registry.service.ts:136-146`) patches only `order`, `label`, `rule`, `visible`. A `slots` addition reusing a packaged id spreads everything **except** `action` — which is why the runbook's "use `slots.documentList`" advice is right.                                                                           |
| **F5**  | holds                       | `nav-drawer.component.html:10` renders `{{ item.label }}` with no `translate` pipe, so the `labels` catalogue cannot reach a nav entry. Use `overrides.<id>.label`.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **F6**  | **WRONG — withdrawn**       | All four slots are live. Registered `provide-app-extensions.ts:104-106`; `toolbar` rendered `document-detail.html:140`; `tabs` `document-detail.ts:378`; `contextMenu` `browse.ts:459`; `routes` `extension-routes.ts:96` + `provideExtensionRoutes()` at `provide-app-extensions.ts:197`, calling `router.resetConfig` at `extension-routes.ts:112`. |
| **F7**  | holds, **different reason** | The rule bodies are real (`document-rules.ts:52-56`). The **writer** is missing: `provide-app-extensions.ts:174-176` sets `username`, `isAdministrator`, `selectionCount` — never `selection`. Always `false` in effect.                                                                                                                              |

| **F9**  | holds                       | `app.routes.ts:34` defines the route; no nav descriptor references it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **F10** | holds                       | The three ids are registered (`extensions.ts:85,107,116`) but `NAV_ITEMS` places only `acme.navbar.acmeExtensions`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **F11** | **not re-verified**         | Needs a production build, a static serve and a real sign-in attempt. Recorded as unconfirmed rather than restated.

**Twelve of thirteen hold. One was wrong, one was right for the wrong reason, one is unconfirmed.**
That base rate is the argument for re-verifying rather than trusting a dated document.

### Two staleness findings outside Part 6

| Upstream component count | Part 5 said "Six"; Part 1's table said seven | **Seven.** Counted from aliased imports. Part 1 was right. This is the first number the audience asks for. |

### One state finding that would have produced a false slide

The manifest document at `/default-domain/config/agentic-ui` **was not empty** — it held Beat 6's
column overrides from an earlier run (`lastContributor` → "Updated by", `modified` hidden).
Capturing browse in that state and captioning it "the product as shipped" is a customised screen
with a baseline caption — the F8 failure class exactly. **Reset to `{"version":1}` before any
baseline capture.** Added to the runbook as a Beat 1 precondition.

## 3a. What the capture gates caught (Phases C–D)

The harness is `scripts/demo-deck/capture.mjs`. All three falsifiable gates were watched failing
before any output was trusted, and the first honest run then found five problems — **four of them in
my own harness, one in the app**. That ratio is the argument for the gates: none of these was
visible in a passing screenshot.

| Found                                          | Whose fault | Consequence had it shipped                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The route gate was tautological**            | harness     | It compared where it landed against where it had just been told to go — true by construction. A deliberate mis-route passed it; only the content gate caught it. This is the tautological path check this repo has already been burned by, reproduced exactly.                                                                                                          |
| **The console allowlist could never match**    | harness     | Playwright's message is "Failed to load resource: … 403" with **no URL in the text**, so URL-fragment matching matched nothing and the two documented-expected failures failed every run. The tempting fix — allowlist `Failed to load resource` — is the F8 postmortem's own recorded mistake. Split into failed-responses-by-URL and never-allowlisted JS exceptions. |
| **A false PASS from incidental text**          | harness     | `core-04-adfhx-list` asserted `'Workspaces'` and passed **while no document list existed at all** — it matched the domain-hint banner's sentence "Open Sections, Templates, or Workspaces…". An assertion satisfied by unrelated prose is not an assertion. Replaced with a structural predicate on `hxp-document-list adf-datatable [role=row]`.                       |
| **`.first()` matched the select-all checkbox** | harness     | Selected all five rows, so the panel correctly read "select a **single** document" — indistinguishable from a broken panel. The screenshot looked like an upstream defect and was not one.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **A whole run authenticated as `Anonymous`**   | environment | The most expensive one. See below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### The authentication trap, and a correction

Seeding `sessionStorage` is **not sufficient** on this deployment. This Nuxeo has anonymous
authentication enabled — a recorded verified fact — so `/me` answers `200` as `Anonymous` and the
app's SSO-detection path **adopts that session**, overwriting the seeded one. Measured: after seeding
Basic Administrator, `sessionStorage` held
`{"kind":"cookie","username":"Anonymous","isAdministrator":false}`.

The visible result was browse rendering **"Failed to load folder contents."** with `0 result(s)`.
**I initially read that as a functional regression in the runbook's strongest beat, and said so. That
was wrong**, and the check that settled it was cheap: on the identical path, an explicit Basic header
answers `200`. Anonymous simply cannot read the folder, and refusing it is correct behaviour.

The harness now clears cookies before seeding, and **Gate 0 aborts the run** if `/me` is not the
expected user — because a full run as Anonymous passes dedup, passes every route assertion, and
yields empty and error states throughout. Nothing looks wrong until it is on a slide captioned "real
repository".

### A fourth expected error, documented nowhere

`AuthService.clearStaleNuxeoCookieSession()` (`auth.service.ts:156-166`) GETs `/nuxeo/logout` to drop
a stale `JSESSIONID` and swallows failure with `catchError`. Measured against this Nuxeo:
`GET /nuxeo/logout` → **404**, `GET /nuxeo/logout?requestedUrl=/nuxeo/` → **302**. The call omits that
parameter, so **it very likely never clears the session it exists to clear**, and the `catchError`
hides that. It is the app's own defence against the anonymous-adoption trap above, and it is not
working. Allowlisted in the harness with the reason stated; **worth a look on its own merits, and out
of scope for the deck.**

### Verified captures

Five, all distinct by SHA-256, all asserting their own content, run exit 0. The properties shot was
read visually as well as gated: it shows `Q1 2026 Content Strategy Review` with **Created rendered as
`Apr 24, 2026` and Creator as `Administrator`** — the two fields that once rendered a raw ISO string
and `[object Object]`, so W11's `sys` pseudo-schema is visibly working.

> **Caveat for that slide:** `Creator` reads `Administrator` because that is the username. This is
> **D4** — Nuxeo carries only the username on the document, so a real deployment reads `jdoe`, not
> `Jane Doe`. Do not present this field as a display name.

## 3b. Appendix evidence (A2–A8)

Only A4 needed a screenshot. A2 and A3 are real captured CLI output — **not retyped**, saved under
`cli/` in the capture directory. A5–A8 are derived from source.

| Slide  | Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A2** | `npm run beta:upgrade` exit 0, and `--break-slot toolbar` exit 1. Both runs captured verbatim.                                                                                           |
| **A3** | `npm run beta:customer-guardrails` exit 0, plus the same guardrail exit 1 against a throwaway copy carrying one deep import. The real library was untouched — confirmed by `git status`. |
| **A4** | The core-04 capture, annotated from live DOM bounding rects. All six callouts resolved.                                                                                                  |
| **A5** | 5 entry points (**from the guardrail's own output**, not asserted), 8 slots (from `extension-slots.ts`), 4 generators (from `generators.json`), 7 upstream + 13 ours.                    |
| **A6** | The coverage/a11y/security/browser rows in §2, each with its caveat.                                                                                                                     |
| **A7** | The Part 6 re-verification in §1, plus D4 and D5 from the workarounds register.                                                                                                          |
| **A8** | Layer structure from `libs/platform/package.json` (`private: true`, confirmed) and the bridge's location outside the package.                                                            |

### One claim I trimmed rather than made

The runbook says `--break-slot toolbar` "leaves the compile GREEN and only that check goes red — a
clean build and a broken customer". **The failing run does not demonstrate that.** It is 146 lines and
short-circuits from the negative-control notice straight to `FAIL`; the compile checks never run, so
no green compile is observed alongside the red check.

The mechanism is sound and is the gate's stated rationale — nothing type-checks JSON, so a renamed
slot is invisible to the build. But that is a _rationale_, not a jointly-demonstrated result, and the
slide says "this is the failure JSON cannot catch" rather than "we watched it compile clean".

### A third document/code mismatch, in the plan of record

`docs/adf-hx-beta-plan.md` said, in the present tense, "Nine slots are implemented; five are deferred
to GA". Both halves were wrong: source defines **eight**, and commit `7fd5e46` made the last four
live, so **none is deferred**. Confirmed independently by `beta:upgrade`, which prints the shipped set.
Corrected, with the correction noted inline.

Note the direction of the two errors: the plan **understated** the addressable surface while the
runbook's F6 **told a presenter four slots were inert**. The same staleness, read from opposite ends,
in the two documents a presenter would rely on.

### The dedup gate forced a better design

A separate `appx-a4-anatomy` capture was rejected as byte-identical to `core-04-adfhx-list` — same
route, same state, same pixels. The gate was right, and the correct response was not to defeat it: A4
needs that capture _annotated_, not duplicated. One capture, two presentations. A callout whose
selector matches nothing now fails the run, so an anatomy diagram cannot be silently missing a part.

---

## 4. Open item flagged for the presenter

**Phase 6 status is inconsistent in the repo.** The plan document records all seven steps done on
2026-08-31; `.ai/state/phases.json` still carries `"status": "in-progress"` and a `notCovered` list
naming figures the coverage work superseded ("3 of 15 measurable projects", "search 22.76%").

`npm run beta:state` is the machine-checked source and CLAUDE.md points at it, so the mismatch is
load-bearing rather than cosmetic. It is not a presentation problem to paper over — either the state
file is stale and should be updated, or the plan overstates. **Resolve it before a slide quotes
either number.** Not resolved as part of the deck work, because which one is right is a programme
decision, not a documentation one.
