# adf-hx Beta Deliverable — Plan

**Status:** current plan of record · **Last verified:** 24 August 2026
**Position:** see [Programme status](#programme-status) below, or `npm run beta:state`
**Tickets:** [NXENG-619](https://hyland.atlassian.net/browse/NXENG-619) under [NXENG-615](https://hyland.atlassian.net/browse/NXENG-615)
**RFC:** "RFC: Nuxeo Satori Beta - Component Platform and Customer Extensibility Model"
**Agent contract:** [`AGENTS/11-beta-program.md`](../AGENTS/11-beta-program.md) · **Harness:** [`scripts/beta-harness/`](../scripts/beta-harness/)

Supersedes [`docs/adf-hx-poc-action-plan.md`](adf-hx-poc-action-plan.md), which was written before the
four-layer extensibility model and before the dependency questions were settled.

## Programme status

**As at 25 August 2026.** `CLAUDE.md` points here for the authoritative position, and for
weeks there was no such section — so that pointer dangled while `CLAUDE.md`'s own summary
claimed Phase 3 was next, three phases after it had shipped.

Run `npm run beta:state` for the machine-checked version. It reads
`.ai/state/phases.json`, resolves each cited evidence manifest and gate report, and is red
whenever a phase claims more than the artifacts support. **Prefer it to this table**, which
is a human summary and can go stale exactly as its predecessor did.

| Phase                            | Status          | Evidence                   |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| 0 — Verify and unblock           | complete        | 14 checks                  |
| 1 — Layer 0 config               | complete        | 39 checks                  |
| 2 — Layer 1 extension registry   | complete        | 46 checks                  |
| 3 — adf-hx adoption              | complete        | 55 checks                  |
| 4 — Layer 2 publishable platform | complete        | 25 checks                  |
| 5 — Layer 3 agent harness        | complete        | 27 checks                  |
| 6 — Beta quality bar and proof   | **in progress** | steps 0-5 of 7; gate 17/17 |

All six completed phases are re-gated against the current 14-gate pipeline, not only the
smaller pipeline that existed when each was signed off — Phases 0–2 were originally gated
on 4–6 gates. The re-gate matters: two of the gates added since found real defects in
already-signed-off work.

**Deviations are recorded per phase in `.ai/state/phases.json`, not here.** Phase 4 carries
ten, including the one that mattered most: the published package could not be published at
all for the whole phase. Read them before treating a phase as settled.

An independent adversarial review after Phase 5 found defects in every phase, and the
remediation is in git history from `0ccf3f0` onward — publishability, module boundaries,
five defeated gates, and nine security defects across blob-URL lifecycles, subscription
teardown and one `<img [src]>` bypassing the HTTP interceptor.

## Decisions locked

- **adf-hx consumption:** install `@alfresco/adf-hx-content-services` as a real dependency and
  delete the hand-written imitations. No vendoring, no permanent lookalikes.
- **Beta scope:** a deep core slice — browse, folder tree, search, document detail, metadata,
  permissions, versions, upload/CRUD. Workflow, users and groups, administration and publishing
  are out.
- **Customisation model:** a four-layer extensibility contract. AI agents are the authoring
  accelerator for that contract, **not** a licence to edit our source. The contract is the product.
- **Distribution:** versioned libraries plus a thin forkable app template.
- **Layer 1 is additive for Beta, deliberately.** A manifest can add nav items, routes, toolbar
  actions, tabs, context-menu items, bulk actions and columns, and can hide, reorder or relabel
  packaged entries. It **cannot** replace or withdraw a shipped route, or change what a packaged
  document-detail tab renders: `app.routes.ts` imports each feature's `Routes` array directly so
  no packaged route carries an ID, and the six packaged tab bodies are markup rather than
  addressable components. Making either addressable is a rewrite, not a refactor, and is deferred
  to GA. Section 13 of `docs/extension-reference.md` states this to customers, and the slot-state
  table in section 2 is gated by `npm run beta:reference` so it cannot drift.
- **The 90% coverage bar applies to the in-scope slice only.** Projects the scope decision above
  puts out — administration, workflow tasks, KD/KE, assets, trash — plus the reference extension
  libraries and the forkable template, are named in `OUT_OF_SCOPE` in
  `scripts/beta-harness/coverage-gate.mjs` and excused from the bar, but **not** from the ratchet:
  out-of-scope code may still not rot. The default is in-scope, so a new library counts until
  someone argues otherwise. Quote `betaScope.meetingTargetInScope` from the gate's JSON, not the
  whole-repo `meetingTarget`, which mixes the two and overstates both the denominator and the debt.

## The extensibility contract

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  L0["Layer 0 - Configuration<br/>theme, nav, labels, action visibility, presets<br/>no code, no build"]
  L1["Layer 1 - Declarative wiring<br/>manifest references components, rules and actions by registered ID<br/>no customer code"]
  L2["Layer 2 - Customer code<br/>their own library against our published API<br/>their repo, their build, their support boundary"]
  L3["Layer 3 - Agent harness<br/>customer-facing AGENTS knowledge base, generators, guardrails<br/>makes Layer 2 cheap"]

  L0 --> L1
  L1 --> L2
  L3 --> L2
```

Layers 0 and 1 are expected to absorb most customer requests and need no build. Layer 2 exists
because a manifest can only rewire what is already compiled in — ACA's own
`extensions.setComponents({...})` registration confirms this. Layer 3 is the differentiator: the
agent works inside the customer's extension library and the thin template, never in our library
source, which is what preserves the support boundary and the certification claims in NXENG-615.

> **Assumption to validate:** that Layers 0 and 1 cover most requests is a design expectation, not
> a measured fact. Test it against real requests from The Church and one other account before
> Phase 2 fixes the addressable surface.

## Distribution and upgrade model

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph ours [We publish and version]
    libs["@nuxeo-satori/* libraries<br/>semver, documented public API"]
    tmpl["Thin app template<br/>routes, shell, theme, slots"]
    pkg["Marketplace package<br/>prebuilt reference app"]
  end
  subgraph theirs [Customer owns]
    fork["Forked template<br/>their agent works here"]
    extlib["Their extension library<br/>components, rules, actions"]
    cfg["Their configuration<br/>survives upgrade"]
  end
  libs --> fork
  tmpl --> fork
  extlib --> fork
  cfg --> fork
  libs --> pkg
```

Upgrades are an npm version bump for the platform, plus occasional small merges in the template.
That is only true if the public API is genuinely stable — see the encapsulation rule in Phase 3.

### Where configuration lives

The marketplace installer is destructive today:

```xml
<copy dir="${package.root}/web" todir="${env.server.home}/nxserver" overwrite="true" />
```

So configuration must not live inside the packaged `web` directory. Split it:

- **Bootstrap config** (pre-auth: Nuxeo server URL, base href, branding shell, manifest location)
  on a static path the installer does not overwrite, requiring a second non-overwriting copy step
  in [`nuxeo-agentic-ui-package/src/main/resources/install.xml`](../nuxeo-agentic-ui-package/src/main/resources/install.xml).
- **Runtime manifest** (nav, actions, rules, presets, toggles) as a **Nuxeo document** at
  `/default-domain/config/agentic-ui`, fetched through the existing authenticated `HttpClient`,
  with the packaged default as fallback. This inherits Nuxeo versioning, audit, ACLs and per-tenant
  scoping for free, and can be edited from the app itself.

---

## Verified facts (established 20 August 2026)

Settled by first-hand inspection. Do not re-litigate; if you contradict one, prove it first.

- **The package is installable.** A token with scope `read:packages` resolved and downloaded
  `@alfresco/adf-hx-content-services` — a 379,417-byte tarball of 285 files, checksum verified.
- **648 published versions.** `latest` = `7.20.0-automate.292` (19 Jan 2026), `beta` =
  `7.21.0-automate.86` (19 Jun 2026). The earlier "v0.0.8" figure was a stale placeholder in source
  control and was wrong.
- **No stable release in twelve months.** The last true stable, `7.19.5` (21 Aug 2025), declares an
  Angular 15 baseline and predates the surface this plan depends on. We pin an exact prerelease.
- **Twelve API ports are overridable injection tokens, verified in the shipped artifact** —
  `CHECKIN`, `COPY`, `DOCUMENT`, `DOWNLOAD`, `GROUP`, `MODEL`, `MOVE`, `QUERY`, `RENDITIONS`,
  `UPLOAD`, `USER`, `VERSION`, plus `ADF_HX_CONTENT_SERVICES_API_PROVIDERS`. This is the mechanism
  the whole plan rests on.
- **The dependency contract is under-declared:** one peer declared (`@angular/core`) against
  thirteen actually imported, including `@angular/material` at 48 import sites and
  `@alfresco/adf-core` at 10. `npm install` will not warn. Test artifacts also ship — `ng-mocks` in
  a bundle, and a mock exported from the public `/api` entry point.
- **`@alfresco/adf-extensions@9.0.0` is on public npm**, runtime dependency `tslib` only, so
  Layers 0 and 1 need no privileged access. `@alfresco/js-api` is a mandatory peer of both
  adf-extensions and adf-core.
- **The published component surface is richer than first catalogued:** `HxpDocumentListComponent`,
  `HxpDocumentTreeComponent`, `HxpBreadcrumbComponent`, `HxpMetadataSidebarComponent`,
  `HxpPropertiesSidebarComponent`, `ManageVersionsSidebarComponent`, `HxpUiDocumentViewerComponent`,
  permissions dialogs and panels, content share and delete, column management, search filters —
  several with companion `*-action.service` classes reusable in the Layer 1 action registry.
- **Nothing in this repo uses a real adf-hx component.** No `@alfresco/*` dependency is declared,
  locked or installed; zero `@alfresco` imports in source; all 22 `hxcs-js-client` imports are
  `import type`; all 15 `hxp-*` components are declared locally in `libs/shared/adf-hx-bridge`.
- **The branch is sound.** `npm ci` succeeds; installed versions match HFA `develop` exactly
  (Angular 20.3.27, Material 20.2.14, TypeScript 5.8.3, Satori 0.2.0, hxcs-js-client 2.0.111);
  guardrails, lint and build all pass; 280 of 281 tests pass.

---

## Already done

- Phase 1 core: `libs/shared/app-config`, the non-overwriting installer path, eleven tokens
  repointed, config-driven theming and activated i18n. Quality gate 4/4, evidence 38/38.
- Phase 0 verification: dependencies install, gates run, build passes (1.66 MB initial bundle;
  1.69 MB after Phase 1).
- Much of Phase 5: [`scripts/beta-harness/`](../scripts/beta-harness/) (phase evidence runner with
  per-step assertions, verification gate, annotated comparison generator),
  [`AGENTS/11-beta-program.md`](../AGENTS/11-beta-program.md), the `beta-program` rule, and six SDLC
  skills (`beta-phase`, `verify-gate`, `capture-phase-evidence`, `implement-api-port`,
  `adopt-adf-hx-component`, `add-extension-point`).
- Baseline evidence against live Nuxeo: 13/13 checks; showcase artifact 18/18.
- Documentation corrected for the AI backend having moved to its own repo.

---

## Phase 0 — Verify and unblock (**complete**)

1. ~~Obtain a `read:packages` token.~~ Done. **Provision it as a long-lived CI secret** — CI still
   cannot install without it.
2. ~~Resolve the scope conflict in [`.npmrc`](../.npmrc).~~ **Closed — there was no conflict.**
   GitHub Packages serves every `@alfresco` package we need, verified twice by downloading each
   tarball with only that one mapping present. `adf-extensions`, `adf-core` and `js-api` are
   published to public npm _as well_, which is what made a two-registry split look necessary;
   `adf-hx-content-services` is the only GitHub-Packages-exclusive one. Phase 2 briefly repointed the
   scope at public npm and recorded the consequence as a blocker on Phase 3; both the mapping and the
   claim were reverted in `c6a47b2`. **Phase 3 is not blocked on this.**
3. Fix the harness authentication defect: `helpers.login()` injects a session that satisfies the
   route guard but does not reliably authenticate XHRs, producing intermittent `403`s on
   `/nuxeo/api` paths. Use Playwright `httpCredentials`, as
   [`annotate-showcase.mjs`](../scripts/beta-harness/annotate-showcase.mjs) now does.
4. Fix the Node-version test failure: `clipboard.utils.spec.ts` fails on Node 22+ because Node's
   built-in experimental `localStorage` collides with jsdom. CI runs Node 20, contributors do not.
5. Triage the **9 high-severity `npm audit` findings**. NXENG-615 requires no high or critical, and
   the surface grows once adf-core arrives.
6. Delete the unused Material `hxp-document-tree` and open a draft PR so CI runs at all.

## Phase 1 — Layer 0: upgrade-safe configuration (**complete**)

Gates: quality gate **PASS** (4/4 green) · evidence gate **PASS** (38/38 checks, exit 0), after the
remediation below.

> **What the evidence proves, stated precisely.** It proves that configuration alone changes the
> running application's behaviour with a byte-identical bundle, and that absent, denied and
> malformed configuration all leave a working application. It does **not** prove upgrade safety.
> The first cut of the installer targeted `nxserver/web/…`, which is not a docBase and which
> nothing serves; the configuration would have 404'd in every real deployment and the tolerant
> fallback would have hidden it. The path is corrected, and the corrected destination is confirmed
> to be the directory the `/nuxeo` context is served from, but no package has been built,
> installed and upgraded on a real server. That is the Phase 6 upgrade rehearsal. See
> `PHASE-1-REMEDIATION-ADDENDUM.md` in the phase evidence directory.

Delivered:

- `libs/shared/app-config` loads a **bootstrap file** pre-auth and a **runtime manifest** from the
  Nuxeo document at `/default-domain/config/agentic-ui` post-auth, both tolerant of absence, denial
  and malformed JSON. Installed by a second `install.xml` copy with `overwrite="false"` into
  `nxserver/nuxeo.war/agentic-ui-config`, a **sibling** of the bundle and therefore outside the
  destructive copy — which is what makes customer edits survive an upgrade. `nuxeo.war` is the
  Tomcat docBase for the `/nuxeo` context; `nxserver/web` holds only `root.war` and is not served.
- **Eleven `InjectionToken` factories** repointed at the loaded configuration: the Nuxeo API origin
  and server URL, the AI backend prefix, the ARender endpoints, both Content Intelligence operation
  maps, the three SSO tokens and the session timeout. `nuxeo-sso.providers.ts` and its two hardcoded
  SAML registration IDs are deleted.
- **Theming:** `AppThemeId` is no longer a closed four-member union — the theme set comes from
  configuration, each theme carries a CSS-custom-property `tokens` map applied inline to `<html>`,
  and the global override block is token-driven.
- **i18n:** `TranslateModule` was registered but inert; it now loads a real catalogue and layers the
  manifest's `labels` over it, so relabelling is a configuration edit. Extraction covers the slice's
  chrome only.

### Decisions taken 21 August 2026

- **Translations are descoped from Beta.** No further i18n extraction before Beta. The _mechanism_
  stays, because the manifest's `labels` map layers over the catalogue and that is a Layer 0
  capability — a customer relabels without a rebuild. Extraction beyond the slice chrome moves to GA.
- **Remove the residual `!important`.** ~~An appearance change is accepted.~~ **Done, and nothing
  changed visually.** `.sat-tag.sat-tag` beats Satori's component styles on specificity; Satori's
  inline palette is redirected through its own `--sat-tag-*` custom properties; and the dialog
  title needed a 0-3-1 rule to outrank Material's `.mat-typography h2` typography hierarchy.
  Measured before and after by `scripts/beta-harness/steps/phase-1-tag-styles.mjs`.

Remaining, deliberately not attempted:

- An in-app editor for the configuration document; today it is edited as a Nuxeo Note.

### Configuration document ACLs — the model to apply

The runtime manifest is a Nuxeo document, fetched by `AppConfigService.loadManifest()` as
`GET /nuxeo/api/v1/path{manifestDocumentPath}` **using the signed-in user's own session**. Nuxeo's
permission model therefore governs it, with three consequences:

- **Read permission decides who gets the customisation.** A user without Read triggers the tolerant
  fallback and silently sees the _packaged default_ UI. Grant Read to the broadest set of application
  users (typically `members`) or accept an inconsistent UI between users.
- **Write permission is an administrative capability.** Anyone with Write can change navigation,
  hide actions, relabel and flip feature toggles for everyone. Restrict it to `administrators` or a
  dedicated group.
- **Block inheritance on the config folder.** A document under `/default-domain/config/` inherits
  ACLs by default, so a broad Write grant higher up silently confers the ability to reconfigure the
  application.

Two properties worth stating explicitly:

- Storing config as a document gives **versioning and audit for free** — every change is attributable
  and revertible, which a file on disk does not offer.
- **Hiding an action in the manifest is not a security control.** Layer 1 can only reference already
  registered IDs, and the server-side Nuxeo permission still decides whether an operation succeeds.
  Customers must not treat manifest visibility as authorisation.

Phase 6 should test the ACL-denied path: a user without Read must still get a working application on
the default configuration.

## Phase 2 — Layer 1: extension registry (**complete**; toolbar/tabs/columns carried to Phase 3)

Gates: quality gate **PASS** (6/6 green, including the new lockfile and typecheck gates) ·
evidence gate **PASS**.
Reference doc: [`docs/extension-reference.md`](extension-reference.md).

> **What the evidence proves, stated precisely.** It proves that a manifest edit hides, adds,
> reorders, relabels and rule-gates navigation, and that a customer layer wins through
> `$references`. It proves the packaged default reproduces the pre-Phase-2 navigation by ordered
> equality against the ids and labels transcribed from the deleted `const`, not by a count. It
> proves a manifest-added nav item now resolves a registered `sidebar` component instead of a
> placeholder, that a non-administrator is not offered Administration, and that a manifest hides and
> adds a bulk action. It does **not** prove anything about toolbar, tab, context-menu or column
> extensibility, because nothing reads those slots.
>
> **The bundle digests are weaker than first claimed.** Nine steps hash the script bytes on every
> pass, and an earlier version of this section said they would fail "if configuration were dead".
> They would not: the dev server does not rebuild between reloads, so they pass regardless. They rule
> out one alternative explanation — that a rebuild rather than the manifest produced the change — and
> they read `script[src]` only, so a lazy chunk pulled in by dynamic `import()` is outside them. The
> DOM assertions are the load-bearing part.

Delivered:

- **`libs/shared/extensions`**, wrapping `@alfresco/adf-extensions@9.0.0` for its domain-neutral
  parts — `mergeObjects` (so `$references` layering has ACA's exact semantics, including merge-by-id
  and `.$replace`), `filterEnabled` and `sortByOrder`.
- **Slots are additive by construction.** Keyed by opaque string, with no enum, union or `switch` on
  slot identity, so a tenth slot needs no change to the nine. A spec registers a slot the library has
  never heard of and asserts the nine unchanged. This downgrades **R8 from Medium to Low**: the
  addressable ceiling is now ordinary backlog rather than an irreversible decision.
- **Rules:** the four document-permission predicates registered as `app.rules.*` with no change to
  the predicates. Plus `core.every`/`core.some`/`core.not` as ordinary registered evaluators rather
  than special cases. An **unregistered rule id fails open**, so a manifest typo cannot strip working
  actions out of the UI — safe precisely because Layer 1 visibility is not an authorisation boundary
  — **except** for the three user rules, which fail closed so that an unregistered
  `app.rules.hasAdministrationAccess` cannot offer Administration to everyone during startup.
- **Navbar and sidebar:** `PLATFORM_NAV_ITEMS` is deleted. The same fifteen entries are
  `PACKAGED_NAV_ITEMS` registered into the `navbar` slot behind a signal-backed `APP_NAV_ITEMS`
  token — a signal, not a const, because the manifest arrives asynchronously and nav rules depend on
  the signed-in user. The ~15 path getters in `nav-drawer.component.ts` now key on the nav item id,
  and the shell's hardcoded `path === '/administration'` filter is replaced by a manifest-visible
  `app.rules.hasAdministrationAccess` rule.
- **`ExtensionOutletComponent`**, generalising `DynamicDrawerComponent` via `createComponent()`:
  resolution by registered id, lazy component loaders and input binding. It replaces nav-drawer's
  ad-hoc `Promise.all` of dynamic imports and gives the drawer's fallback branch real content.
- **`$references` merge**, with `$ignoreReferenceList`, `.$replace` and unresolvable layers reported
  rather than swallowed.

Delivered at closure (21 August 2026):

- **The action registry.** `ExtensionActionDescriptor` in a slot says where and when;
  an `ExtensionActionHandler` registered by id says what. The handler shape is adf-hx's
  `*-action.service` shape, so Phase 3 can substitute an upstream service under the same
  descriptor id. `enabledRule` disables rather than hides, which today's UI needs.
- **`bulk-actions` converted.** The six fixed `@Output()` buttons in
  `selection-topbar.component.html` are now `PACKAGED_BULK_ACTIONS` plus six action
  services. Adding a seventh was a button, an output and a shell handler — three files
  across two projects; it is now two registrations. Proven by an ordered-equality spec
  against the ids the markup rendered, and by an evidence step that hides one and adds
  one from a manifest.
- **The document rule context is populated.** Document detail publishes the focused
  document, so `canWrite`, `canRemove`, `canAddChildren`, `canManagePermissions` and
  `hasDocument` work there; `isTrashed`/`isNotTrashed` are added. Selection cardinality
  moves to its own `selectionCount` field so the cardinality rules go live while the
  permission ones stay honestly inert.
- **Fail-closed for security-relevant rules**, a lockfile-integrity gate, a direct
  typecheck target for the library, and `core.not` corrected to upstream's NOR.

Not attempted, and carried into the phase that adopts the components:

- **The document-detail toolbar, its seven-item overflow menu and its five `mat-tab`
  children**, and browse's row `contextMenu` and `documentList` columns. Those five slot
  ids are reserved and **nothing reads them** — `docs/extension-reference.md` says so
  rather than implying an extension point exists. The toolbar was designed as descriptors
  and then not shipped: eight of its eleven controls carry per-action dynamic state
  (`isLocked`, `isFavorite`, `isSubscribed`, `isInClipboard`, `actionInProgress`,
  `hasVersion`) that the descriptor shape does not yet express, and inventing those fields
  under time pressure risked a visible regression in the most-used page. Phase 3 replaces
  much of that markup with adf-hx components anyway, so the fields should be designed
  against the upstream shape rather than against ours.
- **Route contributions.** `app.routes.ts` still imports feature `Routes` arrays directly.
- **The two selection permission rules remain inert.** `SelectionService` tracks ids, not
  documents, so `app.rules.canWriteSelection` and `app.rules.canRemoveSelection` still
  answer `false`. Making them live costs a fetch per selected row.

## Phase 3 — adf-hx adoption (**complete**)

**Real components, not imitations.** Swap in one at a time behind `/#/browse-adf-hx`, deleting each
hand-written `hxp-*` equivalent in the same change. Order: `document-list`, `breadcrumb`,
`document-tree`, `metadata-sidebar`, `permission`, `manage-versions` (a capability the POC lacks
entirely), `document-viewer`, `search`.

`HxpDocumentListComponent` is a **go/no-go spike**, not the first of a batch. Its inputs are typed on
the HxPR SDK `Document` and the upstream neutral-type work has not started, so mapping fidelity is
the real risk. Re-baseline the rest of the phase from what the spike measures.

Scope note: the bridge implements 2 of the 12 API ports. The Beta slice needs roughly ten —
document, query, upload, version, download, renditions, user, group, move, copy.

**Hard rules for this phase:**

- Import the **upstream** API tokens and delete the bridge's local clones (`DOCUMENT_API_TOKEN`,
  `QUERY_API_TOKEN`, `ROOT_DOCUMENT`, `DEFAULT_REPOSITORY_ID`). Angular resolves by token identity,
  so the clones do not satisfy adf-hx components.
- **Pin an exact prerelease version.** Never a range, never a dist-tag — `latest` is itself a
  prerelease.
- Maintain our own pin manifest for the thirteen undeclared peers.
- **adf-hx types must never appear in our public API signatures**, enforced by a lint or
  API-extractor gate.
- Update `.cursor/rules/adf-hx-browse-poc.mdc`: its ban on Material was written for hand-built
  components and adf-core brings Material in transitively.

Fix the bridge defects in the same phase, since adf-hx components consume the mapped documents:
hardcoded `sys_effectivePermissions`, the silently dropped sort, the overwritten `totalCount`, the
50-child ceiling with no pager, and the `browse_column_settings` localStorage collision.

## Phase 4 — Layer 2: publishable platform (**complete**, 10 deviations recorded)

- Give the libraries real build targets with ng-packagr. Today every `project.json` has only `lint`
  and `test`, and the only artifact is a prebuilt SPA zip — there is nothing for a customer to
  depend on.
- **Declare the public API surface and a semver policy**, with an automated gate so internal types
  cannot leak into it. This is what makes upgrades a version bump rather than a merge.
- Expose the registration API — our equivalent of `setComponents`, `setEvaluators` and
  `setAuthGuards` — so customer code can contribute by ID.
- Build the thin forkable app template and a customer extension-library starter.

## Phase 5 — Layer 3: agent harness (**complete**)

Largely built. Remaining:

- Split the `AGENTS/` knowledge base into internal and customer-facing halves, and version the
  customer-facing half as a product artifact.
- Add Nx generators for "new extension component", "new action", "new rule".
- Package the guardrail script for customer use.

## Phase 6 — Beta quality bar and proof (**in progress**, steps 0-4 of 7 done)

- NXENG-615's checklist, assessed against the slice: unit coverage above 90% (the bridge has 11
  tests for 2,949 lines today), ~~Playwright E2E on critical paths~~ (**done** — `npm run beta:e2e`,
  12 specs; not in PR CI because it needs Docker Nuxeo, recorded as a limitation), WCAG 2.1 AA,
  SAST and SCA clean, Chrome and Safari verified.
- **Reference customer extension** exercising Layers 0-2 — a nav item, a rule-gated action, a custom
  component and a rebrand — with zero edits to our libraries.
- ~~**Upgrade rehearsal:** install, customise, upgrade, and verify configuration and extensions
  both survive.~~ **Done** — `npm run beta:upgrade`, gate `upgrade-rehearsal`. Eight assertions
  across Layers 0-2. The decisive one is that every slot the JSON manifest names still exists in
  the upgraded package: nothing type-checks JSON, so a renamed slot leaves the build green and the
  customer's entries silently gone. `--break-slot toolbar` demonstrates exactly that.

**Progress, and what each step still needs**

Step 6 is most of the 20-30 day estimate on its own. `document-detail` and `search` are the two
largest files in the repository and are 60pp short each.

## Timeline

| Phase                  | Focused       | With AI support |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| 0 — Verify and unblock | 1-2 d         | 1 d             |
| 1 — Layer 0 config     | 12-18 d       | 7-11 d          |
| 2 — Layer 1 registry   | 15-22 d       | 9-14 d          |
| 3 — adf-hx adoption    | 30-45 d       | 20-29 d         |
| 4 — Layer 2 platform   | 18-26 d       | 11-16 d         |
| 5 — Layer 3 harness    | 4-6 d         | 2-4 d           |
| 6 — Quality and proof  | 20-30 d       | 12-18 d         |
| **Total**              | **100-149 d** | **62-93 d**     |

Roughly 5-7 months focused, or 3-4.5 months with AI support. These are engineering judgements
calibrated against this branch, not measurements; re-baseline after the Phase 3 spike, which is the
first task with a comparable prior.

Against the Q3/Q4 2026 Beta target, only the AI-supported pace fits. **If it slips, gate Beta on
Phases 0-3 plus 6** — Layers 0 and 1, the adf-hx slice and the quality bar — and follow with Layers
2 and 3 for GA. That still ships a configurable, upgrade-safe, adf-hx-based product and defers only
customer-authored code.

| R11 | **CI now needs Alfresco-org package access.** `@alfresco/adf-extensions` became a production dependency in Phase 2, and the `@alfresco` scope resolves from GitHub Packages, so `SATORI_GH_READONLY_TOKEN` must carry `read:packages` for the Alfresco org — not only `@hylandsoftware`. Untested until a build installs it. _(Supersedes an earlier claim that the scope spanned two registries and blocked Phase 3: all four `@alfresco` packages were confirmed downloadable from GitHub Packages alone, twice.)_ | Medium             | Rotate the CI secret to a token with proven Alfresco access. The first attempt to test this was invalid: `.npmrc` had been repointed but `package-lock.json` still held `registry.npmjs.org` URLs, and `npm ci` installs from `resolved` rather than from the registry mapping. The lock is now regenerated against GitHub Packages, so the next run does settle it. |

## Still open

- Who owns the `read:packages` CI secret?
- Which exact adf-hx version do we pin — the January `latest` prerelease, or the June `beta`, which
  is closer to the surface verified in `develop`?
- Does Beta ship as a marketplace package, an npm library set, or both? Phase 4 assumes both.
- Do we keep `/#/browse-adf-hx` as a parallel route through Beta, or cut over `/#/browse` once
  parity is reached?
- ~~How much of the app becomes addressable by ID in Layer 1?~~ **Answered in Phase 2, and the
  question turned out to be less consequential than it looked.** Nine slots are implemented; five are
  deferred to GA. Because slot registration and resolution are per-slot with no central dispatch,
  adding a slot later is additive, so this is no longer a decision that has to be right first time.
- What is the supported Nuxeo LTS matrix for Beta, which determines the contract-test grid?
