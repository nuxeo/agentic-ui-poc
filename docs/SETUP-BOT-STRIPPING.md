# Bot Co-Author Stripping Setup - Complete

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Created Husky Commit-Msg Hook

**File:** [`.husky/commit-msg`](.husky/commit-msg)

```bash
node scripts/strip-bot-coauthors.mjs "$1"
```

This hook runs **automatically on every commit** for all developers.

### 2. Created Stripping Script

**File:** [`scripts/strip-bot-coauthors.mjs`](scripts/strip-bot-coauthors.mjs)

**Removes these bot co-authors:**

- `github-actions[bot]`
- `dependabot[bot]`
- `renovate[bot]`
- `Claude Sonnet 4.5` / `claude`
- `Cursor` / `cursoragent`

**Preserves:**

- ALL human co-authors
- Commit message content
- Commit structure

### 3. Created Documentation

**Files:**

- [`docs/bot-coauthor-policy.md`](./bot-coauthor-policy.md) - Full policy explanation
- [`docs/cla-configuration-guide.md`](./cla-configuration-guide.md) - Updated with bot stripping reference

### 4. Tested and Verified

**Test commit:** [`ab52012`](https://github.com/nuxeo/agentic-ui-poc/commit/ab52012)

**Input (what was typed):**

```
feat: add automatic bot co-author stripping

...message...

Co-authored-by: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
Co-authored-by: github-actions[bot] <github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>
```

**Output (what was saved):**

```
feat: add automatic bot co-author stripping

...message...

(no co-authors - both bots were stripped)
```

✅ **Hook works correctly!**

## How Developers Use This

### For New Developers

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/nuxeo/agentic-ui-poc.git
cd agentic-ui-poc

# Install dependencies (this installs hooks automatically)
npm install

# Now all commits automatically strip bot co-authors
git commit -m "feat: my change"
```

**No manual setup required!** The `prepare` script in `package.json` runs `husky` automatically.

### For Existing Developers

```bash
# Update from main
git pull origin main

# Reinstall hooks (if needed)
npm install

# That's it! Hook is now active
```

### Making Commits

**No change to developer workflow:**

```bash
# Write your commit as usual
git commit -m "feat: add feature

Co-authored-by: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
Co-authored-by: Alice Smith <alice@example.com>"

# Hook runs automatically:
# ✓ Removed bot co-authors from commit message

# Commit is saved WITHOUT bot co-authors:
# - Claude Sonnet 4.5: REMOVED
# - Alice Smith: KEPT (human)
```

**Key points:**

- AI tools (Cursor, Claude) can still add co-authors
- The hook strips them silently before commit is created
- Human co-authors are preserved
- No `--no-verify` needed (that's only to bypass ALL hooks)

---

## Verification

### Check Hook Is Installed

```bash
ls -l .husky/commit-msg
# Should exist and be executable

cat .husky/commit-msg
# Should show: node scripts/strip-bot-coauthors.mjs "$1"
```

### Test the Hook

```bash
# Create test commit with bot co-author
echo "test" >> test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "test: verify hook

Co-authored-by: claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Check commit (should NOT have claude)
git log -1 --pretty=fuller
```

### Check Specific Commit

```bash
# View commit with full details
git log -1 <commit-hash> --pretty=fuller

# Check for co-authors
git log -1 <commit-hash> | grep "Co-authored-by"
```

## What This Solves

### ✅ Problem: CLA Warnings for AI Bots

**Before:**

```
CLAassistant commented:
"cursoragent has not signed the CLA"
```

**After:**

- Bot co-authors removed from commits
- CLA only sees human contributors
- No false warnings

### ✅ Problem: Noisy Git History

**Before:**

```
Author: John Doe
Co-authored-by: claude <...>
Co-authored-by: github-actions[bot] <...>
Co-authored-by: Alice Smith <...>
```

**After:**

```
Author: John Doe
Co-authored-by: Alice Smith <...>
```

### ✅ Problem: Legal Ambiguity

**Before:** Unclear if AI bots need CLA signatures

**After:** Only humans in git history, only humans need CLA

---

## Edge Cases

### Multiple Bot Co-Authors

**Input:**

```
feat: change

Co-authored-by: claude <...>
Co-authored-by: cursoragent <...>
Co-authored-by: github-actions[bot] <...>
Co-authored-by: Human <...>
```

**Output:**

```
feat: change

Co-authored-by: Human <...>
```

✅ All bots removed, human preserved

### Only Bot Co-Authors

**Input:**

```
feat: change

Co-authored-by: claude <...>
Co-authored-by: cursoragent <...>
```

**Output:**

```
feat: change
```

✅ All bots removed, no co-authors remain

### No Co-Authors

**Input:**

```
feat: change
```

**Output:**

```
feat: change
```

✅ No changes (hook runs but does nothing)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Hook Not Running

**Symptom:** Bot co-authors still in commits

**Fix:**

```bash
# Reinstall hooks
rm -rf .husky/_
npm install

# Verify hook
cat .husky/commit-msg
chmod +x .husky/commit-msg
```

### Hook Fails

**Symptom:** `git commit` fails

**Check:**

```bash
# Node version (must be 20.x)
node --version

# Test script
node scripts/strip-bot-coauthors.mjs /tmp/test.txt

# Check script exists
ls -l scripts/strip-bot-coauthors.mjs
```

### Want to Keep Bot Co-Author (Rare)

```bash
# Skip hook (bypasses ALL hooks)
git commit --no-verify -m "message"
```

⚠️ **Warning:** Also skips linting, formatting, and guardrails

---

## CI/CD Compatibility

### GitHub Actions Workflows

**No changes needed!**

Our workflows use `github-actions[bot]` as the commit author:

```yaml
- name: Configure git
  run: |
    git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
    git config user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
```

**This is the AUTHOR, not a co-author** - hook doesn't touch it.

### Other CI Systems

If your CI adds co-author trailers, they'll be stripped if they match bot patterns.

**To preserve a CI bot co-author:**

Add it to the allowlist in `scripts/strip-bot-coauthors.mjs`:

```js
const BOT_PATTERNS = [
  // ... existing patterns ...
  /^Co-authored-by:\s+my-ci-bot\s+<.*>$/im,
];
```
