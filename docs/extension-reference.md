# Extension reference — Layer 1

**Status:** current · **Introduced:** Phase 2 (Beta) · **Audience:** customers, partners and their agents

Everything a manifest can address, by ID. An extension point nobody can discover is not an
extension point, so this file is the contract: if an ID is not listed here, do not depend on it.

## 1. Read this first

### IDs are a public contract

Every ID below follows `<owner>.<surface>.<name>` — `app.bulkActions.delete`, `app.rules.canWrite`,
`app.navbar.browse`. Use your own owner prefix for anything you contribute (`acme.navbar.contracts`).
Once published, **renaming one of our IDs is a breaking change** and will only happen in a major
version.

### Hiding an action is not a security control

Layer 1 decides what the UI _offers_. It does not decide what the server _allows_. Nuxeo evaluates
the real permission server-side on every operation, so:

- hiding `app.bulkActions.delete` does not stop a user who has `Remove` from deleting via the REST API;
- showing it does not grant anything — the operation still fails with 403 without the permission;
- an **unregistered rule ID evaluates to `true`**, deliberately, so a typo or a manifest written
  against a newer release cannot silently strip working actions out of the UI. The exception is
  the three user rules in section 4, which fail **closed** — an unknown
  `app.rules.hasAdministrationAccess` must not hand every user the Administration
  entry while the shell is still starting up.

Use Nuxeo ACLs for authorisation. Use the manifest for what the interface presents.

### A manifest cannot rebind a packaged action

Hiding is yours to decide; **rebinding is not**. When a manifest entry reuses a packaged ID it
patches that descriptor — `label`, `icon`, `order`, `rule` and the rest all apply — but an `action`
it supplies is **ignored**:

```json
{ "id": "app.toolbar.addToFavorites", "action": "app.toolbar.delete" }
```

That entry changes nothing. Were it honoured, the user would see a star reading "Add to Favorites"
and delete the document, and the server would authorise it, because it really is that user asking.
The rule in the section above — that the server still checks permissions — is what makes hiding
safe, and it is exactly what does **not** make this safe: the user has `Remove`, so the deletion
succeeds. Presentation and behaviour have to stay attached to each other.

To introduce behaviour, add a descriptor under **your own** ID, where the label and the action are
both yours:

```json
{ "id": "acme.toolbar.archive", "label": "Archive", "action": "acme.actions.archive" }
```

Replacing what a packaged ID _does_ is a Layer 2 operation: register a handler under that ID from
your own library (section 14), where the change is in reviewed, versioned code rather than in a
JSON fragment.

### Where the manifest lives, and how it survives upgrade

Layer 0 and Layer 1 are contributed, not edited. Since NXSAT-312 a customer ships their own
Marketplace package that contributes `bootstrap` and `manifest` fragments to the
`org.nuxeo.agentic.ui.config` extension point, and the server serves them after our defaults at
`/nuxeo/agentic-ui-config/bootstrap.json` and `manifest.json`. Ordering needs two declarations:
the package's `package.xml` depends on `nuxeo-agentic-ui`, which orders installation, and its
component `<require>`s `org.nuxeo.agentic.ui.config.defaults`, which orders contributions so our
defaults are always registered first. Everything at that path is served without authentication —
put nothing secret in a fragment.

Scaffold that package rather than writing it by hand:
`npx nx g @nuxeo-satori/platform:config-package acme-config --owner=acme` (from the published
package; in a clone of this repository, `npx nx g ./tools/satori-generators:config-package acme-config --owner=acme`) writes both
declarations, starter fragments with JSON schemas for your editor, and a `build` target whose
`build.mjs` refuses what the server would reject — JSON that does not parse, a repeated key, a
fragment over 1 MiB, a missing asset — and writes the installable zip. `config-packages/presales-demo`
in this repository is one, with two demo presets. The `bootstrap.json` that used to be copied and edited beside
the bundle is **removed with no migration**: a file left in `nxserver/nuxeo.war/agentic-ui-config`
is not served.

The application fetches both, anonymously and together, before anything renders, and applies
the fragments in the order the server lists them, our defaults first. A key a later fragment sets
wins over an earlier one. Each fragment's `extensions` block is handled in two stages. First its
`$references` resolve against its own `$layers` only, so one package cannot reach another's named
layers. Then the resolved blocks merge in the same order, and that merge is **not** isolated: slot
entries with the same `id` merge across packages, so a later package can patch a descriptor an
earlier one contributed. Nothing is read from the repository: the Nuxeo Note at
`/default-domain/config/agentic-ui` that held the manifest before NXSAT-312 is no longer read, by
any request, with **no migration** — re-create its content as a manifest fragment in your package.
Nothing about configuration changes when a user signs in or out.

`AppConfigService.diagnostics()` reports where each half came from (`configuration-service` or
`packaged-default`), the package component behind every fragment, and the server's own
diagnostics — a replacement it rejected, a contribution it removed.

The Layer 1 configuration is the `extensions` key of a manifest fragment:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "extensions": {
    "$name": "acme-customisation",
    "overrides": { "app.navbar.browseAdfHx": { "visible": false } },
    "slots": {
      "navbar": [
        {
          "id": "acme.navbar.contracts",
          "label": "Contracts",
          "path": "/browse/contracts",
          "icon": "folder",
          "order": 35
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Most examples later in this reference start at `overrides` or `slots`: they show the contents of
this `extensions` key, and in a package's `manifest.json` they go inside it. At the top level of a
fragment those keys are ignored without an error. The JSON schema the generator writes flags them in
your editor; the package build does not.

### Presales presets

A demo server can carry several named configurations and switch between them per browser, without
reinstalling anything. A bootstrap fragment declares them:

```json
{
  "presales": {
    "presetSwitching": true,
    "presets": {
      "acme": {
        "label": "Acme Insurance",
        "bootstrap": { "branding": { "applicationTitle": "Acme Insurance" } },
        "manifest": { "labels": { "nav.item.browse-adf-hx": "Claims" } }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Open the application with `?preset=acme` — before or after the `#` — and that preset's `bootstrap`
and `manifest` are applied after every package's fragments. The choice is remembered in
`localStorage` (`agentic-ui.preset`) until `?preset=` clears it, and a badge in the header names
the preset in force. **Nothing happens unless a package sets `presetSwitching: true`**: on any
other server the parameter and the stored choice are both ignored, and the diagnostics and the browser console say so. A
later fragment's `presetSwitching` wins, so a customer package can switch it off. A preset name
is up to 64 letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-`, starting with a letter or digit; a preset whose
name breaks that rule is skipped, and an unknown name is reported and forgotten.

Presets are package content, served anonymously like every fragment. Switching chooses among them
for one browser; it grants nothing and changes nothing on the server.

## 2. Slots

A slot is a named, ordered list of descriptors. Nine exist for Beta, of which six
carry packaged entries.

| Slot           | What it addresses                         | Status in Beta                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `navbar`       | Primary platform navigation entries       | **Populated** — packaged entries in section 3      |
| `bulk-actions` | Actions over a multi-document selection   | **Populated** — packaged entries in section 5      |
| `sidebar`      | Drawer content behind a navbar entry      | Resolves; **no packaged entries** — see section 6  |
| `routes`       | Application routes                        | Resolves; **no packaged entries** — see section 11 |
| `toolbar`      | Document-detail toolbar and overflow menu | **Populated** — 16 packaged actions, section 8     |
| `contextMenu`  | The browse "More actions" menu            | **Populated** — 4 packaged actions, section 10     |
| `tabs`         | Document-detail tab children              | **Populated** — 6 packaged tabs, section 9         |
| `documentList` | Document list columns                     | **Populated** — 12 packaged columns, section 7     |
| `documentView` | The View tab body on document detail      | Resolves; **no packaged entries** — see section 9a |

Read the three states precisely, because they are different promises:

- **Populated** — packaged descriptors exist, the surface renders from them, and
  your `overrides` and `slots` entries change what a user sees.
- **Resolves** — the host asks the registry for this slot, so a descriptor you
  contribute does take effect, but nothing of ours is registered there.
- **Nothing resolves it** — the id is reserved and the registry accepts entries,
  but no code reads them. Contributing to one of these does nothing today.

`rules` was listed as a slot in an earlier version of this document. It is not
one: rules are registered in `ExtensionRuleRegistry` and are referenced by
descriptors, not contributed as descriptors. A manifest writing `slots.rules` was
silently inert, and the constant has been removed rather than left implying
otherwise. See section 4 for how rules are actually addressed.

Deferred to GA and deliberately absent: `content-metadata-presets`, `badges`,
`userProfileSections`, `search` filters, `create`.

### Slots are additive

Slot IDs are plain strings. There is no enum, union or `switch` on slot identity in the registry, so
a tenth slot needs no change to the nine and no new release of the registry —
`libs/shared/extensions/src/lib/extension-slot-registry.service.spec.ts` proves it by registering a
slot the library has never heard of and showing the nine unchanged.

### Fields every descriptor honours

| Field      | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`       | Required. The address. An entry without one is dropped.                                                                                                                             |
| `order`    | Ascending. Absent sorts as `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` — after any ordinary number, tied with that value, before `Infinity`. `null` sorts as `0`. Packaged entries are spaced by ten. |
| `disabled` | `true` removes the entry. ACA's semantics: any truthy value does, the string `"false"` too.                                                                                         |
| `rule`     | A rule ID, or a nested rule reference — see section 4.                                                                                                                              |

Action descriptors (`bulk-actions`, and the other action slots when they are
populated) honour four more:

| Field         | Meaning                                                                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `label`       | Required. Menu text, and the accessible name of an icon-only control.         |
| `icon`        | Icon name understood by the host's icon set.                                  |
| `tooltip`     | Hover text. Falls back to `label`.                                            |
| `enabledRule` | A rule ID. When it denies, the control renders **disabled** rather than gone. |
| `action`      | Registered handler ID. Defaults to the descriptor `id`.                       |

### Per-ID overrides

`extensions.overrides` is keyed by **descriptor ID, never by slot**, so a slot invented after Beta
ships is hideable, reorderable, relabellable and gateable with no schema change.

| Key       | Effect                                                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `visible` | `false` removes the entry.                                                            |
| `order`   | Replaces the packaged order.                                                          |
| `label`   | Replaces the packaged text with a **literal**, in every language. See the note below. |
| `rule`    | Replaces the packaged rule. **`null` clears it**, ungating the entry.                 |

#### Relabelling: two mechanisms, and which one you want

Packaged entries carry both a `label` (the English literal) and a `labelKey` (a translation key).
The renderer prefers the key when it resolves. That gives you two ways to change the text, and
they are not interchangeable.

| You want                    | Set                                         | Result                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One wording, every language | `overrides["app.navbar.collections"].label` | Your literal, verbatim, in all locales. Translation is bypassed entirely. |
| Replace a translation key   | `labels["nav.item.collections"]` (Layer 0)  | Your text wherever that key resolves, the same in every language.         |

The manifest's `labels` map is not keyed by language: `AppTranslateLoader` layers the same map
over every language's catalogue. Per-language wording is not configurable today.

**Setting `label` disables the key for that entry**, deliberately and by design: a manifest
literal is an instruction to show exactly that string, so it must win. If you set both, `label`
wins and your `labels` entry does nothing — that is defined behaviour, not a bug, but it is the
most likely way to confuse yourself.

Your `label` is **never** treated as a translation key. It is rendered as written, so a literal
containing dots — `"v2.0 Archive"` — is safe.

Find an entry's `labelKey` in `PACKAGED_NAV_ITEMS`; they follow `nav.item.<slug>`.

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "app.navbar.trash": { "visible": false },
    "app.navbar.collections": { "label": "Repository", "order": 5 },
    "app.navbar.administration": { "rule": "app.rules.isAdministrator" }
  }
}
```

## 3. `navbar` — the packaged navigation

Registered by `PACKAGED_NAV_ITEMS` in `libs/shared/extensions/src/lib/nav-items.ts`.

| ID                              | Label               | Path                   | Order | Rule                                |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| `app.navbar.knowledgeDiscovery` | Knowledge Discovery | `/knowledge-discovery` | 10    | —                                   |
| `app.navbar.dashboard`          | Dashboard           | `/dashboard`           | 20    | —                                   |
| `app.navbar.browse`             | Browse              | `/browse`              | 30    | — (`disabled`, see below)           |
| `app.navbar.browseAdfHx`        | Browse              | `/browse-adf-hx`       | 40    | —                                   |
| `app.navbar.recentlyViewed`     | Recently viewed     | `/recently-viewed`     | 50    | —                                   |
| `app.navbar.search`             | Search filters      | `/search`              | 60    | —                                   |
| `app.navbar.expiredQueue`       | Expired Queue       | `/expired-queue`       | 70    | —                                   |
| `app.navbar.assets`             | Assets              | `/documents`           | 80    | —                                   |
| `app.navbar.tasks`              | Tasks               | `/tasks`               | 90    | —                                   |
| `app.navbar.favorites`          | Favorites           | `/favorites`           | 100   | —                                   |
| `app.navbar.collections`        | Collections         | `/collections`         | 110   | —                                   |
| `app.navbar.personalSpace`      | Personal Space      | `/personal-space`      | 120   | —                                   |
| `app.navbar.clipboard`          | Clipboard           | `/clipboard`           | 130   | —                                   |
| `app.navbar.trash`              | Trash               | `/trash`               | 140   | —                                   |
| `app.navbar.administration`     | Administration      | `/administration`      | 150   | `app.rules.hasAdministrationAccess` |

`app.navbar.browse` ships `disabled: true` and is therefore not rendered: `/browse-adf-hx`
is the browse entry the product offers. The descriptor stays registered because `/browse`
is still a live route, so it still supplies that page's title. An `overrides` entry cannot
bring it back — `visible` is the only visibility field there and `disabled` outranks it.
Restating the ID as a `navbar` slot addition with `"disabled": false` does, which is the
supported route for a customer who wants both browse surfaces.

**Hiding an entry hides the navigation, not the route.** `{"visible": false}` and a
denying `rule` both remove the entry from the sidebar; neither removes the route,
and a user with the URL still reaches the page. The page keeps its title when
hidden, because the title falls back to the packaged label — a hidden entry
should not turn the page heading into the product name. Removing access is a
Nuxeo ACL or a route guard, not a manifest edit.

`app.navbar.settings` exists as the settings drawer entry and is rendered by the shell rather than
resolved from the slot; it is listed for ID reservation, not as an extension point.

Adding an entry:

```json
{
  "slots": {
    "navbar": [
      {
        "id": "acme.navbar.contracts",
        "label": "Contracts",
        "path": "/browse/default-domain/contracts",
        "icon": "folder",
        "order": 35,
        "hasDrawer": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`hasDrawer: true` opens the secondary drawer. Its content comes from the `sidebar` slot — see
section 6. Without a registered sidebar component the drawer shows a placeholder, which is a
supported state but not a useful one.

---

## 4. `rules` — the registered predicates

Referenced as a bare string (`"app.rules.canWrite"`) or as an object with parameters
(`{ "type": "core.every", "parameters": [...] }`). `parameters` must be a JSON array; anything
else — `"parameters": "File"` with the brackets forgotten — is read as an empty list rather than
breaking the slot it sits in.

### Document rules

Registered by `DOCUMENT_RULE_EVALUATORS`. These wrap the existing pure predicates in
`libs/shared/nuxeo-client/src/lib/utils/document-permissions.ts` — the permission logic is unchanged.

| ID                               | True when                                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app.rules.canWrite`             | The user has `Write` or `WriteProperties` on the focused document |
| `app.rules.canRemove`            | The user has `Remove`                                             |
| `app.rules.canAddChildren`       | The user has `AddChildren`                                        |
| `app.rules.canManagePermissions` | The user has `WriteSecurity` or `Everything`                      |
| `app.rules.hasDocument`          | A document is in focus                                            |
| `app.rules.isType`               | The focused document's type is one of the `parameters`            |
| `app.rules.hasFacet`             | The focused document carries at least one facet in `parameters`   |
| `app.rules.isTrashed`            | The focused document is in the trash                              |
| `app.rules.isNotTrashed`         | A document is in focus and is not in the trash                    |

`app.rules.isType` and `app.rules.hasFacet` take the type or facet names as `parameters`, matched
exactly — Nuxeo names are case-sensitive. With no string parameters — or `parameters` that is not
an array — both answer `false`, so a misconfigured entry is hidden rather than shown everywhere.
Nuxeo Web UI offers the same two tests through `nuxeo-filter`'s `type` and `facet`. Show the
Publishing tab only on Case and Claim documents:

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "app.tabs.publishing": {
      "rule": { "type": "app.rules.isType", "parameters": ["Case", "Claim"] }
    }
  }
}
```

and negate with `core.not`, or combine with `core.every` — `hasFacet("Versionable")` alongside
`isType("Claim")` is an ordinary composite.

**Scope, stated plainly.** "The focused document" means the document open on
`/#/doc/:uid`. That page is the only surface that publishes one, and it clears it
when you navigate away, so all nine answer `false` everywhere else. In particular the two
type rules gate document-detail **tabs and toolbar actions**; they cannot vary browse list
columns by type, because a list has no single focused document. An earlier
version of this document described the first five as functional with no caveat
while nothing populated the context at all, so they answered `false` everywhere.
That is fixed; the remaining limit is which surfaces have a focused document.

### Selection rules

| ID                               | True when                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `app.rules.hasSelection`         | At least one document is selected    |
| `app.rules.hasSingleSelection`   | Exactly one document is selected     |
| `app.rules.hasMultipleSelection` | More than one document is selected   |
| `app.rules.canWriteSelection`    | Every selected document is writable  |
| `app.rules.canRemoveSelection`   | Every selected document is removable |

The first three read the selection **count**, which the shell publishes, so they
are live and `app.bulkActions.compare` uses one of them today.

**Caveat, unchanged:** the last two are still inert. `SelectionService` tracks
IDs, labels and previews — not documents — so there are no permissions to test
and both answer `false`. Populating them would cost a fetch per selected row.
Do not reference those two yet.

### User rules

These three **fail closed**: if one is referenced before it is registered, it
denies rather than permits.

| ID                                  | True when                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `app.rules.isAdministrator`         | The user is in `administrators` |
| `app.rules.isPowerUser`             | The user is in `powerusers`     |
| `app.rules.hasAdministrationAccess` | Either of the above             |

`rule: null` in an override still clears the gate, so a customer who genuinely
wants an entry ungated has a Layer 1 route to it. Fail-closed is about the
unknown-ID case, not about making the gate un-overridable.

### Surface-state rules

Registered by `SURFACE_RULE_EVALUATORS`. Where the document rules above read the
document, these read what the open surface has published about its own state —
whether the document is already a favourite, whether an operation is in flight.
They exist so that a **toggle** is two addressable descriptors rather than one
descriptor whose label the component rewrites: `app.toolbar.addToFavorites` and
`app.toolbar.removeFromFavorites` are separate ids gated by opposite rules, so a
manifest can relabel, reorder or hide either half and the label it sets is the
label that renders.

| ID                        | True when                                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `app.rules.isFavorite`    | The focused document is in the user's favourites   |
| `app.rules.isLocked`      | The focused document is locked                     |
| `app.rules.isSubscribed`  | The user has notifications on the focused document |
| `app.rules.isInClipboard` | The focused document is in the clipboard           |
| `app.rules.hasVersion`    | The focused document has at least one version      |
| `app.rules.isAiEnabled`   | The AI feature flag is on                          |
| `app.rules.isNote`        | The focused document's type is `Note`              |
| `app.rules.isNotBusy`     | None of the named operations is in flight          |

Only the positive form of each is registered. The negative half is an ordinary
composite a manifest can write for itself:
`{ "type": "core.not", "parameters": ["app.rules.isFavorite"] }`.

`app.rules.isNote` is the exception in this table: it reads the focused document, not
something the surface published, and answers exactly as
`{ "type": "app.rules.isType", "parameters": ["Note"] }`. It used to read a `note` flag
that document detail derived from that same document, so its answer is unchanged on every
surface. It stays registered by `SURFACE_RULE_EVALUATORS`.

`app.rules.isNotBusy` takes the operation names as parameters, because an
operation name is data rather than contract:
`{ "type": "app.rules.isNotBusy", "parameters": ["trash"] }`. With no parameters
it is vacuously true. The packaged toolbar uses it as an `enabledRule`, so a
control greys out while its own request is in flight instead of disappearing.

**Same caveat as the document rules.** These describe the surface, not the
server. Nuxeo evaluates the real permission on every operation regardless.

### Composites and constants

| ID           | Semantics                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `core.every` | All nested rules pass. Empty list is `true`.    |
| `core.some`  | Any nested rule passes. Empty list is `false`.  |
| `core.not`   | True when **every** nested rule is false (NOR). |
| `core.true`  | Always `true`.                                  |
| `core.false` | Always `false`.                                 |

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "app.navbar.trash": {
      "rule": {
        "type": "core.every",
        "parameters": ["app.rules.isAdministrator", "app.rules.hasDocument"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A self-referential or mutually recursive composite is broken rather than allowed to overflow the
stack; the cycle evaluates to `true`.

## 5. `bulk-actions` — the packaged actions over a selection

Registered by `PACKAGED_BULK_ACTIONS` in
`libs/shared/extensions/src/lib/packaged-actions.ts`, rendered by the selection
topbar that appears when at least one document is selected.

| ID                                | Label               | Icon            | Order | Enabled when                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------- | ----- | -------------------------------- |
| `app.bulkActions.downloadZip`     | Download All as Zip | `download`      | 10    | always                           |
| `app.bulkActions.addToCollection` | Add to Collection   | `library_add`   | 20    | always                           |
| `app.bulkActions.compare`         | Compare             | `compare`       | 30    | `app.rules.hasMultipleSelection` |
| `app.bulkActions.addToClipboard`  | Add to Clipboard    | `content_paste` | 40    | always                           |
| `app.bulkActions.publish`         | Publish Document    | `publish`       | 50    | always                           |
| `app.bulkActions.delete`          | Delete selected     | `delete`        | 60    | always                           |

None of them carries a `rule`, deliberately: all six are offered whatever the
user may do with the selection, exactly as they were before they became
descriptors. **Nuxeo decides whether the operation succeeds**, server-side, on
every one of them. Adding `app.rules.canRemoveSelection` to Delete would hide it
from everyone, because that rule is still inert — see section 4.

Adding your own:

```json
{
  "slots": {
    "bulk-actions": [
      { "id": "acme.bulkActions.archive", "label": "Archive", "icon": "inventory_2", "order": 15 }
    ]
  }
}
```

The descriptor decides where and when; a registered handler decides what. A
descriptor with no handler renders and is inert rather than throwing, so a
manifest can be written before the Layer 2 library that backs it ships.

```ts
import { ExtensionActionRegistry } from '@nuxeo-satori/platform/extensions';

inject(ExtensionActionRegistry).register({
  'acme.bulkActions.archive': inject(AcmeArchiveActionService),
});
```

Handlers are objects with an `execute(context)` method — the shape adf-hx uses
for its own `*-action.service` classes. Re-registering one of our IDs replaces
the behaviour without forking, and it stays replaced: the packaged surfaces
register their own handlers in a lower-precedence tier, so yours answers whether
it was registered before or after the page that ships the ID, and navigating away
from that page does not withdraw it.

`register()` returns a registration. A handler that closes over a component must
withdraw it — `registration.unregister()` — when that component is destroyed, or
the registry keeps the destroyed component reachable. Withdrawal is per
registration and never by ID alone, because an ID is shared: yours and ours can
both be registered under `app.toolbar.delete` at once.

Section 14 has the full rules, including why your handler outranks ours whatever the
registration order. Prefer it over this paragraph if the two ever disagree.

## 6. `sidebar` — drawer components

Two mechanisms share this name, and the distinction matters.

- The IDs in the table below are **component-registry** IDs, not slot
  descriptors. The drawer resolves them by convention: a nav entry
  `app.navbar.<name>` is served by a registered component `app.sidebar.<name>`.
  That is what a manifest-added nav entry picks up with no further wiring.
- The `sidebar` **slot** is consulted first, and has **no packaged entries**.
  Contribute a descriptor there — `{ "id": "acme.navbar.contracts", "componentId":
"app.sidebar.searchFilters" }` — when you want a nav entry served by a component
  whose ID does not follow the convention.

An earlier version of this document listed the slot as "Implemented" and pointed
at the table below, conflating the two.

Components are referenced by ID and must already be compiled in. Contributing a new one is Layer 2.

| Component ID                      | Renders                                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app.sidebar.assets`              | Asset facet filters                                                                |
| `app.sidebar.searchFilters`       | Search filter panel                                                                |
| `app.sidebar.trashFilters`        | Trash filter panel                                                                 |
| `app.page.contracts`              | A full-page surface, for the `routes` slot                                         |
| `nxs.components.permissionsPanel` | Local and inherited permissions in the document-detail and browse Permissions tabs |

`app.page.contracts` is the first component registered for the **`routes`** slot rather than for a
drawer, and it exists because that slot went live with **no component in the product able to serve
it** — live and unusable, which is the "registered surface with no consumer" failure this programme
has been caught by before. Route to it, and give it a nav entry, entirely from a manifest:

```json
{
  "extensions": {
    "slots": {
      "routes": [{ "id": "app.page.contracts", "path": "contracts" }],
      "navbar": [
        { "id": "acme.navbar.contracts", "label": "Contracts", "path": "/contracts", "order": 15 }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Several nav entries may point at one page; `inputs` on the route descriptor is how you vary what it
shows. The component itself must be compiled in — **that** part is Layer 2, once. Everything after
it, including moving the page, renaming it and rule-gating it, is Layer 1 and needs no build.

The packaged nav entries with bespoke drawer markup (browse tree, tasks, clipboard, favorites,
collections, recently viewed, expired queue, personal space, settings, administration) are rendered
directly by the shell and are not addressable as sidebar components in Beta.

By convention a nav item `app.navbar.<name>` is served by `app.sidebar.<name>`. A manifest-added nav
item whose ID follows the convention picks up a registered component with no further wiring.

## 7. `documentList` — the packaged columns

Twelve columns, registered by the application and resolved by both the production
browse and the adf-hx browse route. So `overrides` and `slots` entries here take
effect on the rendered list.

**Nine of the twelve ship `hiddenByDefault`.** That is not the same as `disabled`:
a hidden column is still offered in the column picker, so a user can switch it on,
whereas a `disabled` column is dropped from the resolved list and disappears from the
picker too. Collapsing the two would make "hide by default" indistinguishable from
"remove", and a manifest could then only ever delete a column, never pre-fold one.

| ID                                 | Label            | Field             | Order | Sortable | Hidden by default |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ----- | -------- | ----------------- |
| `app.documentList.title`           | Title            | `title`           | 10    | yes      | no                |
| `app.documentList.type`            | Type             | `type`            | 20    | yes      | yes               |
| `app.documentList.modified`        | Modified         | `modified`        | 30    | yes      | no                |
| `app.documentList.lastContributor` | Last Contributor | `lastContributor` | 40    | yes      | no                |
| `app.documentList.state`           | State            | `state`           | 50    | yes      | yes               |
| `app.documentList.version`         | Version          | `version`         | 60    | no       | yes               |
| `app.documentList.created`         | Created          | `created`         | 70    | yes      | yes               |
| `app.documentList.author`          | Author           | `author`          | 80    | yes      | yes               |
| `app.documentList.nature`          | Nature           | `nature`          | 90    | no       | yes               |
| `app.documentList.coverage`        | Coverage         | `coverage`        | 100   | no       | yes               |
| `app.documentList.subjects`        | Subjects         | `subjects`        | 110   | no       | yes               |
| `app.documentList.flags`           | Flags            | `flags`           | 120   | no       | yes               |

Move a column and rename it, without a rebuild:

```json
{
  "extensions": {
    "overrides": {
      "app.documentList.lastContributor": { "label": "Updated by", "order": 5 },
      "app.documentList.modified": { "visible": false }
    }
  }
}
```

**`overrides` honours exactly four keys: `order`, `label`, `rule`, `visible`.** Anything
else in an override is silently dropped — see `applyOverride` in
`extension-slot-registry.service.ts`. This example previously used
`"hiddenByDefault": false` in an `overrides` block, which does nothing at all: the
column stayed hidden and the manifest looked correct. Corrected 2026-08-25 after it
was run against a live instance.

To change `hiddenByDefault`, `disabled`, `sortable` or `field`, contribute the
descriptor through `slots` instead. Re-stating an id in `slots.documentList` merges
over the packaged descriptor:

```json
{
  "extensions": {
    "slots": {
      "documentList": [
        { "id": "app.documentList.author", "hiddenByDefault": false },
        { "id": "app.documentList.state", "disabled": true }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Verified behaviour of those two, in the user's own column picker:

- `disabled` removes the column from the picker entirely, so a stored user preference
  cannot resurrect it.
- `hiddenByDefault` only sets the starting state; the column is still offered,
  unchecked, and a user may switch it on. The preference lives in
  `localStorage.browse_column_settings` as a flat array of `field` keys, and `[]`
  means the user switched everything off.

`order` is spaced by ten so an entry can be inserted between two packaged columns
without restating the list.

## 8. `toolbar` — the packaged document-detail actions

Registered by `PACKAGED_DOCUMENT_TOOLBAR_ACTIONS` in
`libs/shared/extensions/src/lib/packaged-actions.ts`, rendered by the header of
`/#/doc/:uid`. Seventeen descriptors, which is more controls than a customer ever
sees at once: the toggles are mutually exclusive pairs, and every entry is gated.

`overflow: true` puts an entry behind the **More actions** menu; the rest are
icon buttons in the header row. `overflow` is a descriptor field like any other,
so `slots.toolbar` can move a packaged action between the two.

| ID                                | Label                 | Icon                   | Order | Overflow | Shown when                              |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ----- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `app.toolbar.edit`                | Edit                  | `edit`                 | 10    | no       | not trashed, writable and not a Note    |
| `app.toolbar.editProperties`      | Edit properties       | `edit`                 | 10    | no       | not trashed, writable and a Note        |
| `app.toolbar.addToCollection`     | Add to collection     | `library_add`          | 20    | no       | not trashed                             |
| `app.toolbar.delete`              | Delete                | `delete`               | 30    | no       | not trashed and `app.rules.canRemove`   |
| `app.toolbar.lock`                | Lock                  | `lock`                 | 40    | no       | not trashed, writable and not locked    |
| `app.toolbar.unlock`              | Unlock                | `lock_open`            | 40    | no       | not trashed, writable and locked        |
| `app.toolbar.addToFavorites`      | Add to Favorites      | `star_border`          | 50    | yes      | not trashed and not a favourite         |
| `app.toolbar.removeFromFavorites` | Remove from Favorites | `star`                 | 50    | yes      | not trashed and a favourite             |
| `app.toolbar.share`               | Share                 | `share`                | 60    | yes      | not trashed                             |
| `app.toolbar.publish`             | Publish document      | `publish`              | 70    | yes      | not trashed, has a version and writable |
| `app.toolbar.subscribe`           | Notify Me             | `notifications`        | 80    | yes      | not trashed and not subscribed          |
| `app.toolbar.unsubscribe`         | Unsubscribe           | `notifications_active` | 80    | yes      | not trashed and subscribed              |
| `app.toolbar.addToClipboard`      | Add to Clipboard      | `content_paste`        | 90    | yes      | not trashed and not in the clipboard    |
| `app.toolbar.removeFromClipboard` | Remove from Clipboard | `content_paste_off`    | 90    | yes      | not trashed and in the clipboard        |
| `app.toolbar.export`              | Export                | `download`             | 100   | yes      | always                                  |
| `app.toolbar.startProcess`        | Start Process         | `play_circle`          | 110   | yes      | not trashed                             |

`app.toolbar.export` is the one entry with no `rule`, deliberately: it was
outside the trashed-document guard in the markup this replaced, and exporting a
trashed document still works.

The document-specific header controls that are **not** in this table —
attachments, Knowledge Enrichment, the trashed-document restore banner — remain
markup. They are conditional on document shape rather than on user intent, and
extracting them would have changed behaviour rather than made it addressable.

Adding your own works exactly as for `bulk-actions`: a descriptor decides where
and when, a handler registered against the ID decides what, and a descriptor with
no handler renders inert rather than throwing.

```json
{
  "slots": {
    "toolbar": [
      { "id": "acme.toolbar.archive", "label": "Archive", "icon": "inventory_2", "order": 35 }
    ]
  },
  "overrides": {
    "app.toolbar.startProcess": { "visible": false },
    "app.toolbar.share": { "order": 15 }
  }
}
```

Moving `app.toolbar.share` to order 15 reorders it **within the overflow menu**;
`overflow` is what decides which of the two groups it is in.

---

## 9. `tabs` — the packaged document-detail tabs

Registered by `PACKAGED_DOCUMENT_TABS` in
`libs/shared/extensions/src/lib/packaged-tabs.ts`.

| ID                     | Label       | Icon           | Order | Shown when              |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ----- | ----------------------- |
| `app.tabs.view`        | View        | —              | 10    | always                  |
| `app.tabs.annotations` | Annotations | —              | 20    | always                  |
| `app.tabs.permissions` | Permissions | —              | 30    | always                  |
| `app.tabs.history`     | History     | —              | 40    | always                  |
| `app.tabs.publishing`  | Publishing  | —              | 50    | always                  |
| `app.tabs.aiInsights`  | AI Insights | `auto_awesome` | 60    | `app.rules.isAiEnabled` |

Hiding, reordering and relabelling these is a manifest edit. **Their bodies are
not addressable**, and that asymmetry is deliberate and worth stating: the six
packaged bodies are still markup in the host template, matched by ID. Extracting
a thousand-plus lines of tab body into separately registered components would
have been a rewrite, and the point of this slot is to make the tab strip
addressable without one. There are two exceptions. The body of `app.tabs.view` can be
replaced per document by a `documentView` entry — section 9a. And the local and inherited
half of `app.tabs.permissions` renders the component registered as
`nxs.components.permissionsPanel`, as does the Permissions tab of `/browse`, so re-registering
that ID from your library (section 14) replaces the panel in both; the external-user section
under it stays packaged. The component receives one input, `documentId`.

A tab you contribute names a registered component instead, through `componentId`,
and is rendered by the same `ExtensionOutletComponent` the sidebar uses. The
component must already be compiled in — contributing one is Layer 2.

```json
{
  "slots": {
    "tabs": [
      {
        "id": "acme.tabs.claims",
        "label": "Claims",
        "icon": "assignment",
        "order": 15,
        "componentId": "acme.components.claimsPanel"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`componentId` defaults to the descriptor `id`, so registering the component under
the tab's own ID is enough. A contributed tab with no registered component
renders an empty body rather than throwing, so the manifest can precede the
library.

---

## 9a. `documentView` — a different View per document type

Resolves, with no packaged entries. The host asks this slot for the body of the
View tab each time the focused document changes, so a Claim can open on a claim
summary while a File keeps the packaged viewer and a Note keeps the note editor.
Nothing of ours is registered here: with no entries, the View tab is exactly what
it was before the slot existed.

| Field         | Meaning                                                                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `componentId` | Registered component rendering the tab body. Defaults to the descriptor `id`. |
| `rule`        | When it denies for the focused document, the entry is skipped.                |
| `inputs`      | Static values set on the component's declared inputs. Unknown keys ignored.   |

**Which entry wins.** Entries whose rule passes are taken in ascending `order`, and the
first whose component is registered renders. Nothing matching, or nothing registered,
renders the packaged view. A registered component whose lazy loader fails also falls
back to the packaged view rather than leaving the tab blank, so a broken chunk costs the
customer their custom view, not the document. The load is retried when the document is
refetched or another document using the same entry opens — at most twice, so a chunk that
is permanently missing is requested three times in all. The packaged view stays on screen
while a retry is in flight.

**The document is the host's.** The component receives the focused document on its
`document` input. A manifest `inputs.document` is overwritten, so configuration cannot
make the tab show a different document from the one the toolbar and properties panel act
on. Declare `document` as an `input()` to receive it; a component that does not declare
it is still rendered, and the value is not set.

The natural rule is a type check, with the packaged `app.rules.isType` (section 4). Any
registered rule works, including one your library registers:

```json
{
  "slots": {
    "documentView": [
      {
        "id": "acme.documentView.claim",
        "componentId": "acme.components.claimView",
        "rule": { "type": "app.rules.isType", "parameters": ["Claim"] },
        "order": 10,
        "inputs": { "heading": "Claim summary" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

For Notes alone, the packaged `app.rules.isNote` reads the same way:

```json
{
  "slots": {
    "documentView": [
      {
        "id": "acme.documentView.notes",
        "componentId": "acme.components.noteView",
        "rule": "app.rules.isNote"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

What this slot does **not** do:

- **Only the View tab.** The other tabs, the toolbar and the properties panel are
  unchanged by any `documentView` entry. Which properties the panel shows per type is a
  layout file, section 9b, not this slot.
- **The packaged views are not entries.** Which one renders is decided per document type
  by a single table inside document detail: a Note gets the note editor, and every other
  type — File, Picture, Video, Audio, your own — gets the document viewer, which picks its
  presentation from the content (mime type, picture views, transcoded videos), not the
  type. That packaged view is also the fallback when your entry's component fails to load,
  so a broken Note view falls back to the note editor. A manifest cannot hide or reorder
  the packaged views — only outrank them with an entry of your own. Registering them as
  entries would publish new ids and is a separate decision.
- **Like every slot, it is not a security control.** Whatever your component reads is
  still gated by Nuxeo server-side.

---

## 9b. Per-type layouts — which properties a document type shows

Not a slot and not an ID: a **layout file** per document type and mode, shipped in your
configuration package, as Nuxeo Web UI keeps a layout per type and mode. This build renders one
mode, `metadata`: the Properties panel on document detail, beneath the packaged rows (title, tags,
description and the Dublin Core vocabularies) and above Attachments. Read-only.

**With no file, the layout is generated from the type's own schemas,** and from those a dynamic
facet adds to the document (next paragraph). One section per schema,
fields by name, each value shown by its schema type. Schemas the panel and viewers already
present are left out — `common`, `dublincore`, `uid`, `file`, `files`, `note`, `facetedTag`,
`relatedtext`, `picture`, `image_metadata`, `iptc`, `video`, `audio`, and the `collectionMember`,
`notification` and `thumbnail` schemas Nuxeo's own facets add to a document as it is collected,
subscribed to and given content — so a stock File or Note shows nothing new, a Claim shows its
`claim` schema, and a schema you add to File appears on File. A type never falls back to its
parent type's file.

**A schema a dynamic facet adds to one document gets a section on that document.** A facet added
after creation (`Document.AddFacet`, or an integration such as HxAI's `Hxai`) brings schemas the
type does not declare, so a File given `ExternalEntity` shows an `externalEntity` section and a
File without it does not. Those sections come after the type's own, in schema-name order, so a
facet never moves the sections every document of the type shows. Each such schema is read once
per session; one that cannot be read is left out, with the reason in the console, and the rest of
the layout still renders.

**A file replaces the generated layout whole.** Only the fields it lists are shown, in its order;
nothing generated is merged in. The type must match exactly.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "display": "sections",
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "summary",
      "label": "Claim summary",
      "fields": [
        "claim:number",
        { "field": "claim:status", "label": "Status" },
        "claim:serviceDate"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "amounts",
      "labelKey": "acme.layout.amounts",
      "fields": ["claim:billedAmount", "claim:allowedAmount"]
    }
  ]
}
```

| Key                   | Meaning                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`             | Required, `1`. Any other value and the file is refused.                                                                       |
| `display`             | `"sections"` (default), or `"tabs"` for one tab per section.                                                                  |
| `sections`            | Required list, may be empty — an empty layout shows nothing.                                                                  |
| `sections[].id`       | Required, unique; 1 to 64 letters, digits, `.`, `_` or `-`, starting with a letter or digit.                                  |
| `sections[].label`    | Heading, as a literal. Wins over `labelKey`. A section with neither has no heading (a tab is named from `id`).                |
| `sections[].labelKey` | Heading, as a translation key.                                                                                                |
| `sections[].fields`   | Required list of `"<prefix>:<field>"`, or `{ "field", "label"?, "labelKey"? }`. Top-level fields only, each once per section. |

A field neither the type nor the document's facets have, an entry that is not `<prefix>:<field>`, or a field listed twice in
one section is skipped and the rest of the file applies; a file that is refused shows the generated layout instead. Both are logged in
the browser console under `[agentic-ui-layouts]`, and the page never breaks. A schema with no prefix
is addressed by its name, as Nuxeo does: `file:content`. Unknown keys are ignored without a message,
so that a file written for a later version still loads.

A file may name a field of a facet's schema, such as `externalEntity:origin` in a File layout. It
shows on a document that carries the facet; on one that does not, it is skipped and logged as for
any field the document lacks, so expect that message for every such document. If the facet's
schema could not be read, the message says so instead of calling the field absent.

How each value is shown is decided by its schema type — there is no widget name to set:

| Field type                     | Shown as                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `string`                       | text                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `string` bound to a vocabulary | the entry's label, read for the entries the document holds only, so a vocabulary of any size costs a read per value; `Parent/Child` for an `l10n…` vocabulary, in English as the panel's own Subjects row |
| `string[]` and other lists     | one chip per item (vocabulary items labelled)                                                                                                                                                             |
| `date`                         | a long date, in UTC, so a calendar date is the same day everywhere                                                                                                                                        |
| `long`, `double`               | a number in the user's locale                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `boolean`                      | Yes or No, translated                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `blob`                         | the file name                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `complex`, `complex[]`         | its sub-fields, one group per item                                                                                                                                                                        |

**Labels.** A field's `label` is shown verbatim; else its `labelKey` if it translates; else the
key `layout.field.<prefix>:<field>`; else a readable form of the field name (`billedAmount` →
"Billed amount"). Generated section headings look up `layout.schema.<schema>` first. So a manifest
`labels` entry renames a generated label with no layout file at all:

```json
{ "labels": { "layout.field.claim:memberId": "Member ID", "layout.schema.claim": "Claim details" } }
```

**Shipping one.** Put the file in your configuration package's bundle and contribute it from the
component that `<require>`s `org.nuxeo.agentic.ui.config.defaults`:

```xml
<extension target="org.nuxeo.agentic.ui.config" point="configuration">
  <layout type="Claim" mode="metadata" src="agentic-ui-config/layouts/Claim/metadata.layout.json" />
</extension>
```

A later package's file for the same type and mode replaces yours whole; `enabled="false"` removes
the one in force. While developing, `npm run config:dev -- --layout Claim/metadata=claim.layout.json`
serves it to `nx serve` the same way.

What a layout file does **not** do:

- **Only the `metadata` mode, read-only.** Edit and create layouts are not in this build; a file
  for another mode is served but not rendered.
- **Not the packaged rows above it.** Title, tags, description and the Dublin Core vocabularies are
  still the panel's own; a `dc:` field you list appears in your layout as well.
- **Folderish types.** Document detail redirects them to Browse, so their Properties panel is never
  shown.
- **Like every configuration, it is not a security control.** A field left out of a layout is still
  returned by the REST API to anyone who may read the document.

## 10. `contextMenu` — the browse "More actions" menu

Registered by `PACKAGED_BROWSE_CONTEXT_MENU` in
`libs/shared/extensions/src/lib/packaged-actions.ts`, rendered by the browse
header. The actions apply to the folder or document currently open.

| ID                            | Label       | Icon                | Order | Shown when     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ----- | -------------- |
| `app.contextMenu.share`       | Share       | `share`             | 10    | always         |
| `app.contextMenu.subscribe`   | Notify Me   | `notifications`     | 20    | not subscribed |
| `app.contextMenu.unsubscribe` | Unsubscribe | `notifications_off` | 20    | subscribed     |
| `app.contextMenu.export`      | Export      | `ios_share`         | 30    | always         |

**Browse has no per-row menu**, in this build or before it. The slot's
description in the section 2 table used to read "row-level menu on a document
list" while the only menu in `browse.html` was this one, which would have sent a
customer looking for a surface that does not exist. The ID is the contract and
stays; the description was corrected.

---

## 11. `routes` — manifest-contributed routes

Resolves, with no packaged entries: the application's own routes are still
imported directly by `app.routes.ts`, so none of them is addressable by ID. What
this slot does is let a manifest add a route that did not exist at build time,
serving a component registered under Layer 2.

| Field         | Meaning                                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `path`        | Required. Relative router path — see the validation note below this table. |
| `componentId` | Registered component ID. Defaults to the descriptor `id`.                  |
| `inputs`      | Static values bound to the component's inputs via route data.              |

A `path` must be a non-empty string, must not begin with `/`, and must not contain
whitespace, `?` or `#`. An entry failing any of those is dropped and reported on
`AppExtensionsService.invalidRoutes()`, alongside the reason — the rest of the batch
still registers. Angular's own router validation runs only in a development build, so
without this an invalid path threw on a dev server and became a permanently unmatchable
route in production.

```json
{
  "slots": {
    "routes": [
      {
        "id": "acme.routes.reports",
        "path": "reports",
        "componentId": "acme.components.reports",
        "inputs": { "reportSet": "claims" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Contributed routes are appended to the shell's children, so they inherit the
navigation and the authentication guard, and they are re-applied whenever the
manifest changes. A `navbar` entry with `"path": "/reports"` then reaches it.

**A route is not an authorisation boundary.** Adding one exposes a component;
whatever it calls is still gated by Nuxeo server-side, and removing a route does
not protect anything the API would otherwise return.

---

## 12. `$references` — layering your JSON over ours

Semantics are ACA's. The merge is our own copy of `mergeObjects` from `@alfresco/adf-extensions`
9.0.0, pinned case by case to its output, so behaviour matches the upstream documentation, apart
from the `null` and `__proto__` items below, where ACA's merge threw or rewrote a prototype.

- Layers apply in the order `$references` lists them. **Later wins.**
- `$`-prefixed keys are **metadata and do not merge** — `$references` from a referenced layer never
  leaks into the result. They are dropped at the top level and inside any object two layers both
  set; inside a value only one layer sets, they are kept as written.
- Arrays of objects merge **by `id`**, so a layer patches one entry without restating the list.
  Entries with an `id` come first, in the earlier layer's order except that integer-like ids such as
  `"2"` go ahead of the rest, ascending; then the earlier layer's entries without an `id`; then the
  later layer's new entries.
- `"<key>.$replace"` replaces instead of merging. Below the top level — `"rule.$replace"` inside an
  override — it takes effect only where an earlier layer set the same parent, and is otherwise kept
  as a literal key.
- A later scalar does **not** replace an earlier object: a number or boolean is ignored and a
  string is spread into it. A later non-array is appended to an earlier array. Use `.$replace`.
- `null` meeting an object, in either order, takes the later layer's value. ACA's merge threw
  there, which broke every slot; `"rule": null` is how a later layer ungates an entry.
- A `__proto__` key never replaces an object's prototype. The merge skips it wherever it iterates
  an object, and a slot or override id named `__proto__` is dropped when the layer is read; inside a
  value taken whole it stays an ordinary data property.
- `$ignoreReferenceList` drops a layer even when it is referenced.
- A layer that cannot be resolved is reported on `AppExtensionsService.missingLayers()`, not silently
  dropped, and the rest of the stack still applies.

```json
{
  "extensions": {
    "$references": ["baseline", "acme"],
    "$layers": {
      "baseline": { "overrides": { "app.navbar.trash": { "visible": false } } },
      "acme": { "overrides": { "app.navbar.collections": { "label": "Repository" } } }
    }
  }
}
```

References resolve one level deep. A referenced layer's own `$references` is metadata and is skipped,
so nesting is ignored rather than half-honoured.

## 13. What Beta does not yet address

Stated so nobody plans around a capability that is not there.

The first two are a **deliberate Beta boundary**, not an oversight: Layer 1 is additive for
Beta. You can add surfaces and you can hide, reorder or relabel packaged ones. You cannot
replace a shipped route or change what a packaged tab renders, beyond outranking the View tab
body per document through `documentView`. Making either addressable is a
rewrite rather than a refactor, so it is deferred to GA. If you need to replace a shipped page,
that is Layer 2 — see section 14.

- **Tab and toolbar bodies.** The six packaged tab bodies and the document-specific header
  controls listed in section 8 are still markup. The tab strip and the toolbar are addressable;
  what a packaged tab renders is not, except the View tab, which a `documentView` entry can
  replace per document (section 9a).

- **The packaged routes.** `app.routes.ts` imports each feature library's `Routes` array
  directly, so no packaged route carries an ID and none can be moved, guarded or removed from a
  manifest. Section 11 covers what the slot does do — add routes that did not exist at build
  time.

  `toolbar`, `tabs`, `contextMenu`, `bulk-actions` and `documentList` were once in this list and
  are **not** any more: all five are Populated per the table in section 2. This bullet named
  document-list columns for weeks after the consumer landed, which is the kind of stale exclusion
  that gets a working capability left out of a demo. The table in section 2 is the authoritative
  statement of slot state and is gated by `npm run beta:reference`; this prose is not.

- **The two selection permission rules**, for the reason given in section 4.
- **An in-app editor** for configuration. Configuration is the fragments in a configuration
  package (section 1), so a change is a new version of that package, built and installed. On a
  demo server, a preset (section 1) switches between configurations per browser.

- **The upstream permissions panel on `/browse-adf-hx` still handles three levels.** That route is
  the adf-hx proof of concept, kept until the components are removed. It represents only `Read`,
  `ReadWrite` and `Everything`, saves by clearing the local ACL and replaying it, and so **refuses**
  to save a document whose local ACL holds anything else rather than delete it — including the
  `sections` root, which Nuxeo grants `members: CanAskForPublishing` by default.

  The product's Permissions tabs — document detail and `/browse` — use
  `nxs.components.permissionsPanel` instead, which has neither limit. It offers every permission
  the server defines: the server's list for the document type, then `Write`, `ReadVersion`,
  `WriteVersion`, `AddChildren`, `RemoveChildren`, `Remove`, `Version`, `WriteSecurity`, `Unlock`,
  `SetRetention` and `UnsetRetention`, then any other permission the server reports. It writes one
  entry per change, so an entry nobody touched is never written. What it still refuses, before
  writing anything and naming each entry and why: an entry that changed on the server after the
  page loaded, editing a deny (Nuxeo's write operations only grant), an entry with no identifier,
  and a permission the server does not define. Its labels for permissions outside that standard set
  are the Nuxeo identifiers, not translated names.

## 14. Registering from your own library (Layer 2)

```ts
import {
  AppExtensionsService,
  ExtensionComponentRegistry,
} from '@nuxeo-satori/platform/extensions';

const extensions = inject(AppExtensionsService);
const components = inject(ExtensionComponentRegistry);

extensions.registerRules({
  'acme.rules.isContract': (context) => context.document?.type === 'AcmeContract',
});

components.register({
  'acme.sidebar.contracts': () => import('./contracts-drawer').then((m) => m.ContractsDrawer),
});

extensions.register('navbar', [
  {
    id: 'acme.navbar.contracts',
    label: 'Contracts',
    path: '/contracts',
    icon: 'folder',
    order: 35,
  },
]);
```

Register from an `APP_INITIALIZER`, not a component constructor. Unregistered rules fail open, so a
late registration means a gated entry is briefly visible.

Re-registering one of our IDs replaces it — that is the supported way to override a packaged rule or
component without forking.

### Replacing what a packaged action does

Section 1 explains why a manifest cannot rebind a packaged action. Here is where you can:

```ts
import { ExtensionActionRegistry } from '@nuxeo-satori/platform/extensions';

const actions = inject(ExtensionActionRegistry);

const registration = actions.register({
  'app.toolbar.delete': { execute: (context) => myArchiveFlow(context.document) },
});
```

`register` puts your handler in the **customer tier**, which always answers ahead of ours — timing
does not matter. That guarantee is deliberate: you register from an `APP_INITIALIZER`, while a
packaged surface registers handlers closing over a live component in `ngOnInit`. Ours is therefore
always the _later_ call, so a single last-wins map would have silently outranked every override you
wrote. `registerPackaged` is the tier we use, and it is only consulted when nobody has overridden
the ID.

`register` returns a registration, and `unregister()` on it withdraws **exactly** the handlers that
call added:

```ts
inject(DestroyRef).onDestroy(() => registration.unregister());
```

It is scoped to the call rather than taking a list of IDs because an ID is shared — we register
`app.toolbar.delete` too, and "withdraw the handlers for these IDs" would have deleted yours the
first time the user navigated away from a document. Withdrawing is only necessary if your handler
closes over something with a lifetime, such as a component instance.
