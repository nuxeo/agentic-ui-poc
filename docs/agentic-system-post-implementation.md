**Repository:** `agentic-ui-poc`
**Implementation date:** April 2026
**Status:** Implemented ✅
**Branch:** `nuxeo-agentic-package`

## How to Use the System

### For Cursor users

Nothing changes for day-to-day work. The `00-master-context.mdc` rule loads `AGENTS.md` automatically. Just describe the task:

```
"Add a download history tab to the user profile page"
"Implement NCO-1234"
"Fix the thumbnail not loading in search results"
"Fix PR comments on PR #42"
```

### For Claude Code users

Open Claude Code in the repository root. `CLAUDE.md` is loaded automatically. Start with your task.

### For Windsurf users

Open the workspace. `.windsurfrules` is loaded automatically. Start with your task.

### For JetBrains AI users

At the start of every session, type:

```
@AGENTS.md
```

Then proceed with your task.

### For any other LLM tool

```bash
./scripts/agent-context.sh | your-llm-tool "your task here"
```

---

## Maintenance Responsibilities

The system is designed to be low-maintenance, but it does have two ongoing responsibilities:

### 1. Keep `AGENTS/` files current

The `staleness-check.yml` workflow will open a GitHub Issue if service files drift from `AGENTS/01-services.md`. For all other changes, the PR checklist enforces the update:

| When...                    | Update...                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| New service method added   | `AGENTS/01-services.md`                                |
| New Nuxeo endpoint called  | `AGENTS/02-nuxeo-apis.md` + `docs/api-integrations.md` |
| Architecture changes       | `AGENTS/00-architecture.md` + `AGENTS.md`              |
| New bug pattern discovered | `AGENTS/08-bug-patterns.md`                            |
| Angular convention changes | `AGENTS/03-angular-conventions.md`                     |
| AI backend route added     | `AGENTS/10-ai-features.md`                             |

### 2. Review automated issues

Each Monday morning, check GitHub Issues for:

- Dead code report (from `dead-code.yml`)
- AGENTS/ staleness report (from `staleness-check.yml`)
- Dependabot PRs (from `dependabot.yml`)

These are informational — action is optional unless a security vulnerability is flagged.

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Tests are enabled but not yet written for existing services.** The CI test step now runs but most `libs/shared/nuxeo-client/` services do not yet have spec files. The first few PRs may see test warnings. Writing tests for existing services is a Phase 2 follow-up task.

2. **`knip` is not yet configured** for this repository. The `dead-code.yml` workflow runs `knip` with default settings, which may produce false positives. A `.knip.json` configuration file should be added to tune what is ignored.

3. **HAIP API key is not stored in GitHub Secrets.** The AI backend workflows do not need it for CI, but deploying the AI backend to staging/prod still requires the key to be added to the deployment environment manually.

4. **Dependabot may open PRs for Angular major versions.** The `dependabot.yml` is configured to ignore Angular major version bumps, but minor/patch updates will still generate PRs. These should be reviewed carefully before merging.

5. **`changelog.yml` requires Conventional Commits.** If a commit does not follow the `feat:` / `fix:` / `docs:` format, it will not appear in the generated changelog. Teams that have not yet adopted Conventional Commits will see sparse changelogs initially.

## Next Steps (Recommended)

| Priority | Task                                                                                 | Effort  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| High     | Write unit tests for existing `DocumentDetailService` and `SearchAggregationService` | 4 hours |
| High     | Add `.knip.json` to configure dead code detection ignore list                        | 1 hour  |
| Medium   | Add Lighthouse CI (`@lhci/cli`) to `ci.yml` for performance gating                   | 2 hours |
| Medium   | Add `@axe-core/playwright` accessibility check to `ci.yml`                           | 2 hours |
| Medium   | Add `markdown-link-check` to `ci.yml`                                                | 1 hour  |
| Low      | Add GitHub labels: `dead-code`, `agents-stale`, `stale`, `dependencies`              | 30 min  |
| Low      | Create `.knip.json` to tune dead code detection                                      | 1 hour  |
| Low      | Write ADR (Architecture Decision Record) for the agentic system itself               | 1 hour  |

## Verification Checklist

Confirm the system is working correctly:

- [ ] Open a new Cursor session — confirm agent reads `AGENTS.md` before starting
- [ ] Open a PR — confirm `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` pre-fills the description
- [ ] Merge a PR to `main` — confirm `changelog.yml` runs and updates `CHANGELOG.md`
- [ ] Wait for Monday — confirm `stale.yml`, `dead-code.yml`, `staleness-check.yml` run
- [ ] Open a PR with a bad pattern (e.g. direct `<img [src]>`) — confirm Copilot flags it
- [ ] Ask Cursor: `"fix PR #N comments"` — confirm it fetches and fixes automatically
- [ ] Run: `./scripts/agent-context.sh | head -20` — confirm context loads correctly
