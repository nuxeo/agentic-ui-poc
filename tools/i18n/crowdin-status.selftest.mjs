/**
 * Controls for `crowdin-status.mjs`'s report body.
 *
 * Only `formatProgress` is covered, and that is the whole risk surface worth covering. The rest of
 * the script is `fetch` against a tenant, which cannot be asserted here and is already proved or
 * disproved by the job going green.
 *
 * What CAN go wrong without any request failing is a reader drawing the wrong conclusion from a
 * correct number — specifically taking a language at 100% translated as a language that will
 * appear in the application. It will not: `export_only_approved: 'true'` means an unapproved
 * translation is never exported. That single misreading is what these controls exist for.
