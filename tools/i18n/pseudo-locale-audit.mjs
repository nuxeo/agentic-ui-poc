/**
 * Walk the app under the `zz` pseudo-locale and report every visible English string.
 *
 * Under `zz` a catalogue-sourced string renders accented and wrapped in `⟦…⟧`. Text that is
 * still plain ASCII prose therefore came from somewhere a catalogue cannot reach — a hard-coded
 * template literal, a descriptor with no key, or a string built in TypeScript. This is the only
 * check in the set that can see what the extraction MISSED, because everything else inspects
 * strings that were already extracted.
 *
 * Server data is excluded by origin, not by spelling: document titles, usernames and
 * aggregation buckets are legitimately English and must never be translated. They are filtered
 * by the containers they render in rather than by a word list, so a genuine miss cannot hide by
 * resembling one.
 *
 * ## It selects `zz` itself, and proves it
 *
 * The packaged bootstrap ships `defaultLanguage: 'en'` and `zz` is deliberately absent from
 * `availableLanguages`, so nothing here made the running application use it. This audit used to
 * navigate and read — against an ENGLISH app, where every string is plain ASCII prose and so
 * every string looks like a miss. The number it printed could not substantiate anything.
 *
 * It now intercepts the Layer 0 config and serves `defaultLanguage: 'zz'`, then asserts the
 * SENTINEL `⟦` is actually on the page before believing a single finding. Without that assertion
 * a run where the pseudo-locale failed to load is indistinguishable from a run where it worked,
 * and the two produce opposite conclusions from identical output.
