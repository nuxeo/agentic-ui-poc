/**
 * Serves the **real** English catalogue to component tests.
 *
 * ## Why a loader rather than just a provider
 *
 * Once templates bind through `| translate`, every component test needs `TranslateService` or
 * it dies with `NG0201`. Providing an empty `TranslateModule.forRoot()` fixes the injector and
 * breaks the assertions: with no catalogue, ngx-translate passes the key through, so a test
 * asserting a button reads `Confirm` sees `shared-ui.confirm-dialog.confirm` instead.
 *
 * That would have meant rewriting roughly two hundred assertions to expect keys — turning tests
 * that check what a user sees into tests that check what a developer typed. Loading the real
 * catalogue keeps them asserting English, which is what they were always about, and has the
 * side effect of failing a test if a key is ever missing from the catalogue.
 *
 * ## Why `readFileSync` rather than an import
 *
 * The catalogue lives in `apps/nuxeo-ui/public/i18n/en.json`. A library importing from an
 * application would invert the dependency direction the whole architecture rests on, and
 * `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` would be right to reject it. Reading the file at test
 * startup keeps the dependency out of the module graph — this is test scaffolding, not
 * production wiring.
