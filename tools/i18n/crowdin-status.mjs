/**
 * Read-only report on what Crowdin actually holds.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The question "is anything translated yet?" could only be answered three ways, and all three
 * were bad. Log into the Crowdin portal, which needs project membership nobody on the team had.
 * Read the token out of GitHub secrets, which the API will not return. Or run the pull and read
 * the pull request it opens — which is how the first destructive sync was discovered, and is a
 * poor way to ask a question, because asking it changes the repository.
 *
 * So this asks over the API and writes nothing. No mutation, ever: if a future edit needs a
 * `POST`, `PATCH` or `DELETE`, it belongs in a different file, because the whole value of this one
 * is that it is safe to run at any time without thinking about consequences.
 *
 * ## What it reports and why that column
 *
 * **Approved**, not translated, is the number that decides what reaches the application.
 * `export_only_approved: 'true'` in `crowdin-conf.yml` means an unapproved translation is never
 * exported, so a language at 100% translated and 0% approved pulls back exactly nothing. Reading
 * the translated column alone would predict a working locale and be wrong about every string in
 * it. Both are printed, approved first.
