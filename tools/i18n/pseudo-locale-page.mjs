 * The one place that makes a browser page render the `zz` pseudo-locale, and proves it did.
 *
 * Both audits need this and only one of them had it. `pseudo-locale-audit.mjs` was fixed to
 * intercept the Layer 0 config and assert the sentinel; `pseudo-locale-deep.mjs` was then wired
 * into `npm run i18n:audit` without it, so the deep pass — the one that opens dialogs and menus,
 * where a missed string is least likely to be noticed by hand — ran against the packaged `en`
 * default. Under English every string is plain ASCII prose, which is exactly what these audits
 * report as untranslated, so its findings were unreadable in both directions: a correctly keyed
 * string looked like a miss, and a real miss was indistinguishable from one.
 *
 * Two separate processes cannot share a browser, so sharing the SETUP is the only way both stay
 * correct when one is changed. That is the point of this module existing rather than the override
 * being copied.
