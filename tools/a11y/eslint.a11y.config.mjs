/**
 * Accessibility-only ESLint config, used by `npm run a11y` and the A11y workflow.
 *
 * ## Why this is a separate config rather than rules added to `eslint.config.mjs`
 *
 * The eleven `@angular-eslint/template` accessibility rules are currently either absent or
 * set to `warn` in this repository:
 *
 *   - the ten library configs set only `click-events-have-key-events` and
 *     `interactive-supports-focus`, both `warn`, so neither gates anything
 *   - `apps/nuxeo-ui` and `apps/nuxeo-satori-template` have no ESLint config at all, so
 *     their 27 templates get no template rule whatsoever — their `lint` targets pass while
 *     having nothing to say about HTML
 *
 * Turning them on in the shared config would change the existing `lint` gate and make it
 * red on pre-existing violations. This config keeps the a11y verdict independent of that
 * gate, so adopting it does not require fixing the debt first.
 *
 * Severities are all `error` here because this config's only consumer decides what to do
 * with them; `scripts/a11y-scan.mjs` owns the pass/fail policy, not the severity.
 *
 * ## Scope, stated because it is easy to over-read
 *
 * `.html` files only. Two known gaps:
 *
 *   1. 24 components declare inline `template:` strings despite CLAUDE.md's "templateUrl
 *      always". This config does not reach them.
 *   2. None of these eleven rules catches an `attr.`-prefixed literal attribute.
 *      `attr.aria-label="…"` without binding brackets renders a DOM attribute literally
 *      named `attr.aria-label`, leaving the control with no accessible name — verified
 *      against the one instance of that in this repository, which the preset reports
 *      nothing on.
 *
 * These are static rules over template source. They cannot see rendered output, so
 * `color-contrast` and anything layout-dependent is out of reach by construction; the
 * live-server axe harness in `scripts/beta-harness/steps/phase-6-a11y.mjs` covers that.
