/**
 * Harvest what the PR reviewer caught, and why we did not catch it first.
 *
 *   node scripts/pr-review-analysis.mjs harvest <pr> [<pr> …]   # -> a JSONL to classify
 *   node scripts/pr-review-analysis.mjs publish <file.jsonl>    # -> appends to Confluence
 *
 * ## What this is for
 *
 * Every review comment that lands on a pull request is a defect the authoring agent shipped
 * and the reviewing agent caught. That gap is the interesting thing: not the individual bug,
 * but the *class* of bug and the reason it was invisible from the inside. Forty-odd of them
 * in one week is enough to see the shape, and the shape is what a pre-PR review skill has to
 * be built from — otherwise it is a list of somebody's habits.
 *
 * So the harvest is mechanical and the classification is not. `harvest` pulls every Copilot
 * finding with its file, line and body and leaves two fields blank; a human or an agent fills
 * them in, judging one comment at a time; `publish` appends the result.
 *
 * "Every" means all three places GitHub puts reviewer feedback — inline review threads, the
 * review **summary body**, and PR **conversation** comments. It used to mean only the first,
 * which on PR #182 harvested 2 rows out of 5 findings: the summary body's verdict and the
 * three findings Copilot had folded into its "Suppressed comments" block were all dropped,
 * and the class counts this page exists to produce were wrong by 60%.
 *
 * ## The two fields that matter
 *
 * `category`   the defect class, from the fixed list below — free text makes rows
 *              incomparable, and an incomparable table cannot tell you what to automate.
 * `whyMissed`  why the author did not see it. This is the column the skill gets built from.
 *              "Careless" is never the answer; if it were, the fix would be "be careful",
 *              which has never worked. Look for the structural reason: a claim nobody
 *              re-read after the code changed, a guarantee asserted in prose and not in
 *              code, a check that tested a proxy for the thing it named.

 * clone. What that bought in practice was four files of churn on every unrelated pull request —
 * the JSONL plus the regenerated skill and its two mirrors — because `publish` ran inside the
 * review loop and the `review-corpus` gate then demanded they be committed with the fix. A
 * two-line accessibility fix carried four files of review bookkeeping.
 *
 * It did not even buy freshness. Measured before this change: the page held 67 findings across
 * eight pull requests while the committed copy held 59 across six, because the missing rows were
 * sitting in the open PRs that had produced them. The repository copy was the stale one, so the
 * duplicate cost churn and lost the argument it was there to win.
 *
 * So the page is the record and the skill points at it. The skill keeps what does not go stale —
 * the defect classes and the four comparisons — and quotes no figure. `stats` fetches the
 * distribution on demand; `check-order` compares the skill's section ordering against the page's
 * ranking. Neither writes to the repository, and nothing here is a gate: both need Confluence
 * credentials, which CI does not have and has never had.
