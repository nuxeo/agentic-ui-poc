/**
 * Negative controls for `assertion-audit.mjs` — proof that each rule can actually fail.
 *
 * `CLAUDE.md`: *a gate is not evidence until you have seen it fail on purpose.* This audit
 * has now been wrong FOUR times in the same place, every time in the `literal-false` guard
 * exemption, and every time it was caught by someone thinking to try a specific input
 * rather than by anything that runs:
 *
 *   1. The first cut climbed the whole ancestor chain to the top-level `if (declarative)`,
 *      so a deliberate unconditional `check(x, false)` anywhere inside it went green.
 *   2. The second stopped at the first conditional and rejected a *constant* guard — but
 *      `classify` only knew about literals, so `if ({})`, `if ([])`, `if (() => false)`,
 *      `if (function () {})`, `if (class {})` and `` if (`x`) `` all reached the exemption
 *      as ordinary guards. Six spellings of `if (true)` that the rule did not recognise.
 *   3. The third closed those six and `new Date()`, one indirection included.
 *   4. The fourth was `if (1 + 1)`. Probing found seventeen more spellings equally silent.
 *
 * Rounds 2 to 4 are the same error three times: the rule was asking *"is this always
 * truthy?"*, a question whose answers have no closed list, so each round bought exactly the
 * cases it thought of. The rule was therefore narrowed rather than patched again — it now
 * decides only whether a condition reads anything the run can change, and states the
 * constants it does NOT decide in its own output. The controls below are in three groups:
 * the rules shown red, the exemption shown still usable, and the declared boundary shown
 * deliberately silent. The third group is new and is the point of round four.
 *
 * Unlike `sanitizer-audit.selftest.mjs`, nothing here perturbs a tracked file: the audit
 * accepts explicit paths, so every control is a fixture written to a fresh temp directory
 * and handed to the audit as an argument. The repository is never touched, and the controls
 * can therefore be run concurrently with anything.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/beta-harness/assertion-audit.selftest.mjs
