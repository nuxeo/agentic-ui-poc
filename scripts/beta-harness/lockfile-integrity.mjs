/**
 * Lockfile integrity gate.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Phase 2's local gates were green for its entire duration while CI was red. A
 * bare `npm install` on macOS pruned optional platform entries the Linux runner
 * needs — `@oxc-resolver/binding-wasm32-wasi`'s nested `@emnapi/core` and
 * `@emnapi/runtime` — and `npm ci` on Linux then refused the whole tree. None of
 * `guardrails`, `lint`, `test` or `build` reads `package-lock.json`, so nothing
 * local could see it.
 *
 * ## Why not just `npm ci --dry-run`
 *
 * Because it would not have caught this. `npm ci` only demands the entries the
 * *current* platform resolves, so on macOS the pruned Linux-only subtree is
 * never looked at and the dry run passes. The gate has to be
 * platform-independent to be worth having, so it checks the invariant directly
 * rather than asking npm to check it for the wrong platform.
 *
 * ## The invariant
 *
 * For every package entry in the lock, each of its non-optional `dependencies`
 * must be resolvable within the lock by Node's own lookup — walk up the
 * `node_modules` chain from the dependent's own path to the root — **and the
 * entry found must actually satisfy the declared version**.
 *
 * The version half is not decoration; it is the whole failure. Name resolution
 * alone passes on the very lock that broke CI: pruning
 * `binding-wasm32-wasi/node_modules/@emnapi/core@1.11.2` leaves the top-level
 * `@emnapi/core@1.11.3` to satisfy the walk by name, while the dependent pins
 * `1.11.2` exactly and `npm ci` refuses with "Missing: @emnapi/core@1.11.2".
 *
 * Version checking is deliberately conservative, because a gate that cries wolf
 * gets switched off: exact pins are compared directly, ranges are checked only
 * when `semver` is resolvable, and anything that is not a plain version or range
 * — `npm:` aliases, `file:`, `git+`, `workspace:`, URLs, dist-tags — is left to
 * the name check alone.
 *
 * `optionalDependencies` are deliberately not required: npm legitimately omits
 * an optional package that no platform in the tree needs, and demanding them
 * would make this gate cry wolf on every lockfile.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/lockfile-integrity.mjs [--lock <path>]
 *
 * Exit code is 1 if any dependency is unresolvable.

/**
 * Is this dependency edge force-resolved by an `overrides` entry in `package.json`?
 *
 * An override exists precisely to install a version some dependency did not ask for —
 * `main`'s block pins 21 transitive packages to patched releases for CVEs — so the
 * resulting range violation is the override working, not a broken lock. Reporting it as
 * "unresolvable" made 24 deliberate security pins look like corruption, which is how a
 * gate teaches people that its output is noise.
 *
 * The waiver is per *edge*, not per package name, because an override key may be scoped to one
 * version line: `"brace-expansion@^5.0.0": "5.0.12"` pins only the v5 copies. Waiving the bare
 * name instead excused every `brace-expansion` edge in a tree that also holds v1 and v2 copies,
 * so a malformed v1 or v2 edge — including a pruned nested copy whose v1 request then walks up to
 * the overridden v5 root entry, which is the Phase 2 failure this gate exists for — was accepted
 * silently.
 *
 * An override entry has two halves and they answer different questions, which is the distinction
 * this got wrong once already by testing the resolved version against the selector:
 *
 *   1. the **key's selector** decides which requests the rule applies to. npm matches it against
 *      the dependency's declared spec, so an edge asking for `^1.1.7` is outside `^5.0.0` and npm
 *      leaves it alone;
 *   2. the **value** is what the override installs. That, not the selector, is what the resolved
 *      version has to be: under `"brace-expansion@^5.0.0": "5.0.12"` a stale 5.0.11 satisfies the
 *      selector while being a version nothing in the tree asked for and the override does not
 *      produce, and the mirror case — a legitimate cross-major `"x@^1.0.0": "2.0.0"` — resolves
 *      outside its own selector by design and must not be reported.
 *
 * A bare key (`"axios": "1.20.0"`) carries no selector, so it applies to every request for that
 * name — but its value still has to be what is installed. Degradations, each so the gate does not
 * cry wolf on what it cannot judge: without `semver` resolvable nothing but the name can be
 * compared, so the waiver is name-level; a selector that is not a valid range — a dist-tag, say —
 * applies to any request; and a value that is not a version or range, such as npm's `"$dep"`
 * back-reference, accepts any resolved version.
 *
 * A nested form (`{ "@angular/build": { "vite": "6.4.3" } }`) is an **ancestry-scoped** rule, not
 * a second global one: it pins `vite` beneath `@angular/build` and leaves every other `vite` edge
 * alone, and it does not pin `@angular/build` itself at all. Flattening it did both of those
 * wrong — the container got a waiver npm never granted it, and the inner pin waived unrelated
 * dependents' edges — so a rule now carries the scope it was nested under, and the container
 * contributes no rule of its own. npm's `"."` self-reference, which *does* pin the enclosing
 * package, is the only thing that gives a container a rule.
 *
 * Scope is matched on the lock's physical layout: the dependent is the scope package's own entry,
 * or lives inside its `node_modules`. That is an approximation of npm's graph ancestry and it is
 * deliberately the conservative half — a dependency hoisted out of the scope package's subtree
 * would be reported rather than waived. No edge in this lock relies on it, which the gate passing
 * is what demonstrates; the alternative, matching on the name alone, is the defect above.
 *
 * @param {string} name package name of the edge
 * @param {string} spec version range the dependent declared
 * @param {string} actual version the lock resolved it to
 * @param {string} dependentPath lock path of the package declaring the edge
