/**
 * Negative controls for `apps/nuxeo-ui-e2e/assertion-failure-reporter.ts`.
 *
 * The reporter is what `scripts/e2e-negative-control.sh` counts, and that control is the
 * thing standing between this repository and a suite full of assertions that pass vacuously.
 * A control nobody checks is worth what the last one was worth: its first version could only
 * ever print FAIL, and the version after that counted navigation timeouts as assertions.
 * Both were wrong for weeks because nothing exercised them.
 *
 * So the four shapes are kept executable. `cases.spec.ts` fails on purpose in each of them
 * and this asserts the reporter's verdict, including two silence assertions — a reporter
 * that counted everything would satisfy the positive check alone.
 *
 *   counted   a failing expect() in the test body
 *   excluded  a throw from a helper in another file
 *   excluded  a rejection on a line the spec wrote, with no expect run   <- the review finding
 *   excluded  a failing expect() inside beforeEach, body never ran
 *   absent    a spec that passed
 *
 * ## The mutation this file's authority rests on
 *
 * Replace the `category === 'expect'` rule in the reporter with the old filename test —
 * count a failure when `errorLocation.file` ends in `*.spec.ts` — and the counted total goes
 * from **1 to 3**: the spec-line rejection and the `beforeEach` assertion both surface at a
 * `cases.spec.ts` line and are admitted, while only the helper throw, located in `helper.ts`,
 * is still excluded. Measured 2026-09-24.
 *
 * The fixture's name is what makes that mutation meaningful, and it was wrong until review
 * pointed it out. While the file was `cases.case.ts` the old rule matched none of the four
 * shapes, so the mutation scored 0 rather than 3 — the self-test could show the old rule
 * counting *nothing*, which is not the defect, and could not show it over-counting, which is.
 * See the header of `cases.spec.ts`.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/beta-harness/assertion-reporter.selftest.mjs
 * Exit 1 if any expectation is unmet.
