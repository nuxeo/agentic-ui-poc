/**
 * Negative controls for `sanitizer-audit.mjs` — proof that each check can actually fail.
 *
 * `CLAUDE.md`: *a gate is not evidence until you have seen it fail on purpose.* Three gates in
 * this programme were green while the thing they guarded was broken — an evidence check that
 * compared script `src` attributes instead of bundle bytes, a path check that was tautological
 * under the dev base href, and a lockfile gate that matched dependency names but not versions.
 *
 * So rather than capture one red run in a transcript nobody re-reads, this perturbs the tree
 * once per check, asserts the audit goes red *for the expected reason*, and restores. It is
 * repeatable, so it keeps answering the question after the next refactor.
 *
 * Every perturbation is applied in memory and written back from the original bytes in a `finally`,
 * with SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP and `uncaughtException` handlers covering the paths `finally` does not.
 * **SIGKILL and power loss remain uncatchable**, so the guarantee is "no dirty tree unless the
 * process is killed outright" — not an absolute one. Recovery is `git checkout` on the paths the
 * handler names. It touches real tracked files, so do not run it concurrently with a build.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/beta-harness/sanitizer-audit.selftest.mjs

 * whole point of reading the ceiling from the merge base is that a contributor cannot edit it.
 * That is also why they were the two invariants no control had ever observed red: with **both**
 * comparisons stubbed out, the selftest still reported `PASS — 51 negative control(s)`.
 *
 * Worse, they are inert on this branch rather than merely untested. The allowlist was *added* by
 * this branch, so it does not exist at the merge base with `origin/main`, `allowlistAtBase()`
 * returns `null`, and every run prints `could not read budgets at the merge base`. The ceiling that
 * the plan describes as uneditable is currently not consulted at all.
 *
 * So the base is moved instead of the tree. Repointing the remote-tracking ref at `HEAD` makes the
 * "merge base" the committed allowlist, and a working-tree perturbation is then measured against
 * it exactly as a real second PR would be. Nothing in `sanitizer-audit.mjs` changes, and no
 * override is added to it — an env var or flag that relocated the ceiling would be a way to switch
 * the ratchet off in CI, which is the opposite of the point.
 *
 * The ref is restored through `restoreAll`, so `finally`, the signal handlers and

 * outright: a stale remote-tracking ref would silently change what every later audit compares

// invariants. Verified by stubbing out both merge-base comparisons: the selftest still reported
// `PASS — 51 negative control(s)`, so "a budget rose from the base" and "a member absorbed more
// calls than the base declared" had no control behind them at all.
//
// See `repointBaseTo` for why the base is moved rather than the tree, and for the more serious
// finding underneath: on this branch those two comparisons are not merely untested but **inert**,
// because the allowlist does not exist at the merge base for this PR.
//
// Each control below asserts the merge-base diagnostic specifically. Other findings do fire
// alongside — the ratchet is deliberately hard to violate in only one dimension, since growing a
// declared count also breaks the count-matches-code check — so the specific substring is what makes
// these controls mean anything rather than the exit code.
//
// NOT YET VERIFIED: that each control fails with `matched: false` when its own comparison is
// stubbed out. Both go red today and match their diagnostic, but the mutation that would prove they
// depend on the merge-base comparison rather than on a co-firing finding has not been run. Until it
// has, treat these two as controls whose specificity is argued, not observed.
