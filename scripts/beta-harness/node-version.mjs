/**
 * Node runtime preflight — gate zero.
 *
 * Exists because of a real, expensive misdiagnosis: an agent running Node 25
 * saw `nuxeo-client:test` fail with `SecurityError: Cannot initialize local
 * storage without a --localstorage-file path` and reported it as a product
 * defect. It was not. Node 25 defines a global `localStorage` getter that
 * *throws* unless a store path is given, and it shadows jsdom's implementation,
 * so `clipboard.utils.spec.ts` blows up on a line that is correct.
 *
 * A red that looks exactly like a code defect but is caused by the runtime is
 * the worst failure mode this harness has, because the obvious "fix" is to
 * damage working code. So the cheapest gate runs first and says so out loud.
 *
 * Three outcomes:
 *   supported  — running the major the repo pins. Nothing to say.
 *   mitigated  — a newer major whose hazards this harness works around. Passes,
 *                but warns that commands run *outside* the gate will break.
 *   unsupported — older than the pinned major, or a hazard with no workaround.
 *                 Fails, because nothing downstream can be trusted.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/node-version.mjs [--json]
 *
 * Environment:
 *   BETA_GATE_NODE_STRICT=1  treat anything but the pinned major as a failure
 *                            (what CI wants; CI already pins Node 20)
 *
 * Exit code is 1 when the runtime cannot be trusted to produce a meaningful
 * result from the gates that follow.
