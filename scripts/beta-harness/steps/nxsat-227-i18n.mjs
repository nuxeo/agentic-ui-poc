/**
 * NXSAT-227 — i18n: the accessible-name fix, and the Layer 0 language key doing something visible.
 *
 * Run:  npm run beta:evidence -- nxsat-227-i18n
 *
 * ## What this file is built to prove, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * It proves three things:
 *
 *   1. No control anywhere in the shell is named with a raw translation key — read off the
 *      rendered DOM, not off a catalogue file. That is the acceptance criterion, and it is the
 *      one an audit would check.
 *   2. The document tree's folder toggle has a real accessible name. This is the W13 defect: the
 *      catalogue holds `DOCUMENT_TREE.TOGGLE_ARIA-LABEL` and upstream asks for the same key with
 *      a trailing space, so before the alias every toggle was announced as
 *      `DOCUMENT_TREE.TOGGLE_ARIA-LABEL <folder name>`.
 *   3. Setting the Layer 0 `defaultLanguage` key to `fr` renders French chrome after a reload,
 *      with no rebuild. Without this the key is configuration that changes nothing.
 *
 * ## Two traps this file is shaped around
 *
 * **The reload is the assertion.** `withHashLocation()` makes `page.goto('/#/x')` a
 * same-document navigation, so `APP_INITIALIZER` does not re-run and a swapped `defaultLanguage`
 * is never read. A locale check written without `page.reload()` passes on the *English* app and
 * certifies nothing. `AGENTS/11-beta-program.md` §3 records this costing a previous run six
 * false failures. Every language switch below goes through `reloadApp`.
 *
 * **The bootstrap route must be registered before the first navigation and must answer
 * `no-store`.** Registered later, the browser serves the already-cached `bootstrap.json` and the
 * interception is never seen.
 *
 * ## Not covered
 *
 * RTL is out of scope (NXSAT-227 open decision Q3, tracked as DS-2277), so no mirrored layout is
 * asserted. Date, number and currency formatting are untouched — `LOCALE_ID` is not wired to the
 * selected language, so a French UI still renders English-formatted dates. Neither is a gap this
 * capture hides; both are recorded in `docs/i18n-localization-plan.md`.

  // it. That is not hypothetical: it is precisely how the app shell's own navigation-tree folder
