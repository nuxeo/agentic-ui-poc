/**
 * Drift gate for the customer-facing extension reference.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `docs/extension-reference.md` is the only document whose header names customers as
 * its audience, and it is the contract they program against: every addressable ID,
 * and for each slot whether it is populated, merely resolvable, or reserved and
 * inert. Nothing checked it against the code.
 *
 * When it was first measured, it was wrong in both directions:
 *
 * - It claimed the `documentList` slot was "Declared; **nothing resolves it**". Twelve
 *   column IDs are registered in `provide-app-extensions.ts`, and **both** the
 *   production browse and the adf-hx route call `resolve()` on it. A customer reading
 *   the reference would believe document list columns are not configurable when they
 *   are — the document undersold a working capability.
 * - It used `app.toolbar.delete` as its running security example. That ID exists only
 *   in spec files, so a customer overriding it would be overriding nothing.
 *
 * Both are the same failure the API surface gate exists for, one document over.
 *
 * ## What it checks
 *
 * 1. Every ID the document presents as real is registered in non-spec source.
 * 2. Every ID registered in non-spec source is documented.
 * 3. Every slot-state claim in the document's table matches whether the slot is
 *    actually registered into and actually resolved.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not check
 *
 * Spec fixtures are excluded from "registered", because a spec is not a contract —
 * `app.rules.definitelyNotRegistered` and `app.toolbar.typo` are test data. It also
 * cannot tell whether a resolved slot is *rendered*: a component may resolve a slot
 * and drop the result. `resolve()` is the closest static proxy for "the host asks",
 * which is what the document's middle state actually claims.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/extension-reference-drift.mjs

/**
 * Comments removed before anything is matched against source.
 *
 * Every check below decides "does the code do X?" by searching source text, and a
 * commented-out `resolve(EXTENSION_SLOTS.tabs)` — or a doc comment quoting one as an
 * example, which is the far more likely case — satisfied that search exactly as well as
 * real code. So a slot the reference calls live could be proven live by its own
 * explanatory comment.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical in this repository. Three generators spliced every
 * registration *inside a comment*, reported success, printed the IDs they had
 * "registered", and passed lint, typecheck and six specs — because nothing distinguished
 * code from prose about code. The same blind spot in a gate whose entire job is to catch
 * a document that overstates the product would have hidden the identical failure.
 *
 * Deliberately naive: a `//` inside a string literal (`'https://x'`) truncates that line.
 * That can only ever *remove* text, so it can make a check miss a real occurrence — a
 * false alarm, loud and investigable — and never invent one. The failure direction that
 * matters here is the silent one, and this closes it.
