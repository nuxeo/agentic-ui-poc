/**
 * Sanitizer bypass audit — the durable half of the SonarCloud security remediation.
 *
 * `docs/sonarcloud-security-remediation-plan.md` section 5 asks for a gate whose job is *not*
 * to find the 34 issues (Sonar already did) but to make the reasoning in section 4 survive the
 * next agent who has not read it. Five checks:
 *
 *   1  Unregistered bypass          every `bypassSecurityTrust*` needs an allowlist entry
 *   2  Stale allowlist entry        an entry whose file or member no longer has a bypass
 *   3  Redundant bypass             a bypass on a locally-minted object URL, unrecorded
 *   4  `Safe*` in a NONE context    `source[src]` / `audio[src]` / `video[poster]`
 *   5  Unpaired trusted HTML        `bypassSecurityTrustHtml` with no sanitiser beside it
 *
 * Plus a **ratchet**: `budgets` in the allowlist caps how many category A and B entries may
 * exist. The counts may shrink and never grow, which is what makes PRs 3–5 of the plan
 * verifiable rather than self-reported.
 *
 * ## Why this parses TypeScript instead of grepping it
 *
 * The first cut of this script used regexes for "enclosing member" and emitted 100+ findings
 * naming things like `of`, `pipe`, `subscribe` and `if` as members. A gate nobody can read is a
 * gate that gets switched off, so it walks the TypeScript **AST** via `ts.createSourceFile`
 * instead — `typescript` is already a dependency, so this costs no install.
 *
 * Check 4 is the one that most needed it. Angular's DOM security schema puts `source[src]`,
 * `audio[src]` and `video[poster]` in `SecurityContext.NONE`, where **no sanitiser runs** and so
 * a `Safe*` value is never unwrapped — it is assigned to the DOM property and coerced by
 * `toString()`, writing the literal string `"SafeValue must use [property]=binding: …"` into
 * `src`. Deciding whether a binding is affected therefore means following the *type* the
 * expression carries, hopping through interfaces (`src.url` → `VideoSource.url`) and `@for` loop
 * variables. Pattern-matching the expression text cannot do that.
 *
 * ## How check 4 decides, and what makes that safe
 *
 * It asks the compiler. `createTypeProgram` builds a real `ts.Program` over `apps/` and `libs/`, and
 * `resolveTemplateType` resolves each binding through its `TypeChecker`. Five rounds before that,
 * type resolution was syntactic — annotation text, declarations gathered by name, alias expansion —
 * and each round found a spelling that slipped past it: `type MediaUrl = SafeResourceUrl`, an
 * imported interface, a *lowercase* alias, an `input.required<T>()`. Each fix closed one spelling;
 * none could close the class, because "does this text look like a Safe type" is not the question.
 * The syntactic resolver is gone rather than dormant — keeping a superseded security implementation
 * beside the live one is how the wrong half gets maintained.
 *
 * Templates are parsed with Angular's own `parseTemplate` for the same reason. A regex asking for
 * `[src]="…"` matched one spelling of a binding and missed `bind-src="…"`, which is the canonical
 * form of the identical property binding, and `[attr.src]="…"`, which reaches the same NONE-context
 * attribute. The compiler's parser enumerates the bindings a template actually has instead of being
 * asked about one syntax at a time.
 *
 * Neither of those is what makes check 4 trustworthy. **It fails closed.** A NONE-context binding
 * whose type the checker cannot resolve — `any`, `unknown` and the error type included, since those
 * are the checker declining to answer rather than answering — is reported, not skipped, and so is a
 * template that will not parse. That is what converts every remaining gap, present and future, from
 * a silent pass into a visible finding.
 *
 * Section 5.1 of the plan is explicit that a template check which cannot see through an alias is
 * worse than none, because it will be trusted wrongly. It was, for five rounds. Hence the checker
 * and the fail-closed default.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/sanitizer-audit.mjs
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/sanitizer-audit.mjs --print          # dump every bypass as JSON
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/sanitizer-audit.mjs --only 4         # run one check (for evidence)

/**
 * Whether a decorator call could carry a component template.
 *
 * This tested `decoratorExpr.expression.getText(sf) !== 'Component'` — the same decide-by-source-text
 * mistake the rest of this file has been rewritten twice to stop making, and here in the **fail-open**
 * direction. `import { Component as NgComponent } from '@angular/core'; @NgComponent({ … })` is
 * ordinary TypeScript and produced no template entry at all, so check 4 had nothing to report on.
 * Verified: aliasing the decorator on `document-viewer.component.ts` while binding a
 * `SafeResourceUrl` to `video[poster]` returned the audit to
 * `PASS — 31 bypass call(s), all accounted for`. `@ngCore.Component({ … })` was invisible the same
 * way.
 *
 * Resolving the identifier through the checker to Angular's own `Component` closes both, and was the
 * first fix here. It is **not** what this does, because it leaves the same shape of hole one step
 * further out: a decorator that wraps or re-exports `Component` from the application's own code
 * resolves to the wrapper, and the template would be skipped again. Establishing identity is the
 * right tool for check 5, where the question is "is this the reviewed sanitiser". It is the wrong
 * tool here.
 *
 * The question check 4 actually needs answered is not "is this Angular's decorator" but "is there a
 * template here, and which class does it belong to". `template`/`templateUrl` inside a decorator
 * argument is itself the evidence, so **any** decorator qualifies, and the identity of the decorator
 * never has to be established.
 *
 * That is inclusive rather than fail-open, and the asymmetry is the justification: a template
 * scanned that no Angular decorator ever compiles can at worst produce one finding on a dormant
 * binding — which is the same trade check 4 already takes everywhere else, since a false positive
 * costs one allowlist line and a false negative is a shipped defect. There is also no way to switch
