/**
 * Type-check every project's **spec** files.
 *
 * ## The hole this closes
 *
 * `CLAUDE.md` warns that `test` does not typecheck, because Vitest strips types through
 * esbuild, and points at `build` and `typecheck` as the gates that do. Both halves of that
 * were true and the conclusion was still wrong:
 *
 * - 19 of 27 projects had no `typecheck` target at all, so nothing type-checked them.
 * - The 8 that did pointed it at `tsconfig.lib.json`, which **excludes** `*.spec.ts` by
 *   construction. So no gate anywhere had ever type-checked a spec file.
 *
 * Turning it on found 43 errors across six projects. They were not cosmetic:
 *
 * - `libs/shared/nuxeo-client` alone held 18, in the most depended-on library in the repo.
 * - Nine were `params.get(x)?.includes(y)` returning `boolean | undefined` where the
 *   `HttpTestingController` matcher requires `boolean`.
 * - `create-import-dialog.component.spec.ts` asserted on `mock.calls[0][1]` of a `vi.fn()`
 *   declared with no parameters, so the argument it checked could not exist at the type level.
 * - One was a genuine production defect: `directoryPickerLabel` required a `label` its own
 *   body read with `?.` and the Nuxeo `SuggestEntries` payload omits.
 *
 * ## Why a workspace gate rather than 27 project targets
 *
 * A per-project target has to be added to each new project and silently covers nothing when
 * it is forgotten — which is exactly how 19 projects came to have none. This discovers
 * `tsconfig.spec.json` from disk, so a new library is covered the moment it has specs, and a
 * project cannot opt out by omission.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/spec-typecheck.mjs
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/spec-typecheck.mjs --json
 *
 * Exit 1 if any spec file fails to type-check.
