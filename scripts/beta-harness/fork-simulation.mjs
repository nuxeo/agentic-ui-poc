/**
 * Fork simulation: compile the template against the **built package**, not the source.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * Every app in this workspace resolves `@nuxeo-satori/platform/*` through
 * `tsconfig.base.json` paths, straight to the sources under `libs/shared`. That is right for the
 * inner loop, and it means the template's green build proves the template compiles
 * against **our source tree** — which is not what a customer has. A customer has the
 * published `.d.ts` files, which are a different artifact: narrowed by the entry
 * point barrels, flattened by the Angular compiler, and reachable only through the
 * generated `exports` map.
 *
 * So a symbol the template uses but the package does not export, or a type that only
 * resolves because of a source-relative import, would pass every existing gate and
 * fail on the customer's first `npm install`.
 *
 * This compiles the template's real source with `paths` repointed at
 * `dist/libs/platform`. Same files, same compiler, different resolution — which is
 * precisely the variable under test.
 *
 * ## Why not npm install the tarball and build for real
 *
 * That is a stronger test and it is already partly covered: `npm pack` → install →
 * resolve every subpath → typecheck a probe is done and recorded in the Phase 4 doc.
 * Doing it for the whole template needs a scratch install of every Angular peer plus
 * a GitHub Packages token for `@hylandsoftware/satori-ui`, so it cannot run offline or
 * in a fork's CI without secrets. This gets the resolution guarantee with no network,
 * which makes it cheap enough to run on every commit. The limits are listed at the
 * bottom of this comment rather than left implied.
 *
 * ## What it does not prove
 *
 * - Not runtime behaviour. It is a compile, so a component that renders wrongly still
 *   passes.
 * - Not the `exports` map. TypeScript resolves through the `paths` override here, so a
 *   broken exports map is invisible — `npm pack` + subpath resolution covers that, and
 *   it is what caught `ng-packagr-lite` shipping four unresolvable subpaths.
 * - Not peer installability. Nothing here checks that a customer can actually resolve
 *   `@angular/material` at the version we declare.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/fork-simulation.mjs
