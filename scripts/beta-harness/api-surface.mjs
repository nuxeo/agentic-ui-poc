/**
 * Public API surface gate for `@nuxeo-satori/platform`.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Phase 4's promise to customers is that an upgrade is a version bump, not a
 * merge. That is only true if the published surface cannot change by accident.
 * Nothing else in this repo can see such a change: `lint`, `test`, `build` and
 * `typecheck` are all perfectly happy when a library gains, loses or reshapes an
 * export, because every in-repo caller is updated in the same commit. The break
 * lands on the customer, one release later.
 *
 * So this reads the **built** `.d.ts` files — the bytes a customer actually
 * installs, not the source — and compares the surface against a checked-in
 * snapshot at `docs/api/platform.api.md`.
 *
 * ## Why not @microsoft/api-extractor
 *
 * Three reasons, in order of weight. It is another dependency on a lockfile that
 * has already cost this programme a phase. It wants a single rolled-up entry
 * point, and this package deliberately ships five. And it is markedly harder to
 * break on purpose, which is the bar every gate here has to clear —
 * `AGENTS/11-beta-program.md` is explicit that a gate nobody has watched go red
 * is not evidence. A small script over the emitted declarations is auditable in
 * one sitting.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not check
 *
 * It records exported **names, kinds and type signatures** per entry point. It
 * does not parse Angular decorator metadata, so a change to a component's
 * selector or input alias is invisible to it, and it does not diff JSDoc. It is a
 * shape gate, not a semantic-compatibility oracle. That limit is stated here so
 * that a green run is not read as "this release is backwards compatible".
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/api-surface.mjs            # check, non-zero on drift
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/api-surface.mjs --update   # rewrite the snapshot

/**
 * Make `dist` fresh rather than guessing whether it is.
 *
 * This gate reads built declarations, so against a stale `dist` it compares yesterday's surface to
 * the snapshot and passes — which is exactly what it did during review of an earlier PR, reporting a
 * clean surface for a service that had gained a public method minutes earlier.
 *
 * ## Why it builds instead of comparing timestamps or hashes
 *
 * Two heuristics were tried and both produced a red that meant nothing:
 *
 *   1. **mtimes**, against `dist/.../package.json`. Anything that rewrites a file with *identical
 *      bytes* bumps its mtime — `sanitizer-audit.selftest.mjs` does precisely that, perturbing files
 *      and restoring the original bytes in a `finally`. Running the selftest turned this gate red
 *      without a character of source having changed. Worse, `npx nx build platform` could not clear
 *      it: Nx hashes content, so the build was a cache hit and `dist` mtimes were never touched.
 *      Only `--skip-nx-cache` worked, and since `build` runs immediately before `api-surface` in
 *      `ALL_GATES` and is itself a cache hit, a full `beta:gate` run could not self-heal.
 *   2. **Content hashes**, recording the source hash against the hash of the `dist` it described.
 *      That fixed the identical-bytes case but wedged a narrower one: a source edit that does not
 *      alter the emitted `.d.ts` leaves `dist` byte-identical, so the record still "describes" it,
 *      the source hash differs forever, and *no* rebuild clears it.
 *
 * Both failures share a cause: inferring freshness from observable side effects of the build. So
 * this asks the build system instead. `nx build platform` is idempotent and a cache hit costs about
 * a second, after which `dist` corresponds to the sources on disk **by construction** — there is
 * nothing left to infer, and no state to keep. The gate is slower standalone and cannot produce an
 * uncleanable red, which is the right trade for something that already refuses to read source.

 * single `export { Foo, Bar, ... }` clause at the end. So every regex missed, and

 * *names* and not one signature — and it duly reported "no change" when a
 * `strictNullChecks` misconfiguration altered 23 published types. A gate that
 * cannot see a type change is not an API gate.
 *
 * ## Why bodies, not just declaration lines
 *
 * The interesting breakages are inside: a method losing an overload, a property
 * turning nullable, a parameter becoming required. Recording `class Foo` would
 * have missed all three. Bodies are captured by brace depth after comments are
 * stripped, which is reliable on emitted declarations — they contain no
 * expressions, no template literals and no regex literals to confuse it.
