/**
 * Asserts that `@nuxeo-satori/platform` **can actually be published**.
 *
 * ## Why this gate exists
 *
 * Phase 4's central claim to customers is that an upgrade is an `npm version` bump. For
 * the whole of that phase the package could not be published at all:
 *
 *     ERROR: Trying to publish a package that has been compiled in full compilation mode.
 *     This is not allowed.
 *
 * ng-packagr writes that as a `prepublishOnly` script into the built `package.json`
 * whenever the entry point was compiled in anything other than partial mode, so
 * `npm publish` hard-fails on the customer's very first install path — while `lint`,
 * `test`, `build`, `typecheck`, `api-surface` and `fork-simulation` were all green,
 * because none of them runs a publish.
 *
 * The cause is worth stating because it has now produced two separate defects.
 * `@nx/angular:package` given a `tsConfig` option calls
 * `parseRemappedTsConfigAndMergeDefaults`, which — despite the name — merges only eight
 * hardcoded options and otherwise **replaces** ng-packagr's bundled
 * `conf/tsconfig.ngc.json`. That bundled file is the only place `compilationMode:
 * partial` is set, and it is also where `strictTemplates` lives. Angular's own default
 * is `FULL`. The first defect from this was 27 wrongly non-nullable public types
 * (missing `strict`); the second was an unpublishable package (missing
 * `compilationMode`). Both were configuration absent rather than configuration wrong,
 * which is the kind no type checker reports.
 *
 * ## What is load-bearing here
 *
 * Two checks do the real work, for different failures.
 *
 * **Check 3** runs `npm publish --dry-run`, the only thing that executes `prepublishOnly`.
 * Checks 1, 2 and 4 are cheap corroborations that name the specific cause when 3 goes red.
 *
 * **Check 7** typechecks the shipped `.d.ts` files with `skipLibCheck: false`. `beta:fork`
 * compiles the app *template* against them, which only exercises the types the template
 * happens to touch — so `avatarColor` shipped as `(name: string) => SatAvatarCategory` with
 * that name declared nowhere in the file, and every gate was green.
 *
 * Checks 5 and 6 assert that what the shipped docs tell a customer to run is actually in
 * the package: the guardrail script, and the four Nx generators.
 *
 * ## Every check here has been watched failing on purpose
 *
 * Re-adding the full-mode `prepublishOnly` turns 1 and 3 red; reverting `compilationMode`
 * turns 1, 2 and 3 red together; deleting a generator factory or the `generators` field
 * turns 6 red; reintroducing the dangling type turns 7 red.
 *
 * **Check 7 silently passed three times before it worked**, and each way is guarded now,
 * because a check that reports success having done nothing is worse than no check:
 *
 * 1. `--types ''` made tsc abort with `TS6044`, and the path filter discarded it. Guarded
 *    by failing on any `TS5xxx`/`TS6xxx` configuration diagnostic.
 * 2. A malformed `paths` entry (`pkg/nuxeo-clientindex.d.ts`, a missing separator) meant no
 *    entry point resolved. `TS2307` is attributed to the importing file, so the filter
 *    discarded that too. Guarded by failing on any unresolved module.
 * 3. Compiling from a temp directory outside the repo meant `node_modules` could not be
 *    reached, producing twenty peer-resolution errors that were the harness's fault. It now
 *    stages inside the repo and imports via the package specifiers a customer writes.
 *
 * ## Safety
 *
 * Nothing here can publish. The dry run happens in a throwaway copy under the OS temp
 * directory, `--dry-run` makes no registry request, and the copy is the only place
 * `private: true` is stripped — the built package keeps it, so a stray real `npm publish`
 * in `dist/` is still refused by npm.

// ------------------------------ 2b. every external import is a declared dependency ----

/**
 * A bare import left in the bundle is a runtime dependency whether or not the manifest says so.
 *
 * ng-packagr does not inline third-party code: `import DOMPurify from 'dompurify'` survives into the
 * FESM output verbatim. If that specifier is in neither `dependencies` nor `peerDependencies`, npm
 * has not been told to install it, so the package resolves fine inside this monorepo — where the
 * root `node_modules` happens to contain it — and fails on `import` for anyone who installs it from
 * the registry. Every other check here passed while `dompurify` was undeclared, including
 * `npm publish --dry-run`, because none of them reads the bundles' import graph.
 *
 * Self-references between entry points are skipped: `@nuxeo-satori/platform/ui` importing
 * `@nuxeo-satori/platform` is the package's own `exports` map, not an external dependency.
 *
 * Specifiers come from a full AST walk. Two earlier attempts were both fail-open:
 *
 *   1. A regex for `… from '…'`, which review pointed out omits the forms that need no `from` — a
 *      side-effect import (`import 'pkg'`) and a dynamic one (`import('pkg')`).
 *   2. `ts.preProcessFile`, which looked like the right tool and is not. It reads only a file's
 *      leading import prologue, so it reported 7 specifiers for the nuxeo-client bundle and missed
 *      the mid-file `import('./reports')` that is plainly in it. A dynamic import of an undeclared
 *      package sits in the middle of compiled code, which is exactly where it stops looking.
 *
 * So the walk below visits every node and collects static imports and re-exports, dynamic
 * `import()`, `require()`, and `import x = require()`. Verified against a side-effect import and a
 * dynamic import injected mid-bundle, both of which the first two approaches passed.
 */

/**
 * Every module specifier in `text`, from anywhere in the file, plus every module load whose specifier
 * is **not** a string literal.
 *
 * The second list is the point. `import(expr)` and `require(expr)` with a computed specifier were
 * silently dropped, so a bundle could load an undeclared external package through a variable and this
 * gate would still report every import as declared — the same fail-open shape as the regex it replaced,
 * one level further in. They are now returned and reported: a specifier this cannot read is a specifier
 * whose declaration cannot be checked, which is not the same as an import that is fine.
