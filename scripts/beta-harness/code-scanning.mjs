/**
 * Code-scanning gate — read the SAST results nobody was reading.
 *
 * ## What this is actually fixing
 *
 * Every document in this repository said **"No SAST"**. That was wrong, and it had been wrong for a
 * month. GitHub's CodeQL **default setup** was configured on 2026-07-24 and has been analysing
 * every push since: 87 JavaScript/TypeScript rules, weekly plus on-push, and it was returning
 * **21 open alerts — 6 of them high**.
 *
 * Nobody saw them, for two compounding reasons:
 *
 * 1. Default setup analyses the **pull-request ref**, so the alerts live under
 *    `refs/pull/145/head`. `GET /code-scanning/alerts` with no `ref` reports on the default branch,
 *    where there are none. Asking the obvious question returned a reassuring zero.
 * 2. Nothing in the gate pipeline, the phase evidence, or CI ever asked.
 *
 * So the gap was never the tool. It was that a tool ran, found things, and no process consumed the
 * output — which is the same failure mode as a gate nobody has watched go red, one layer out.
 *
 * ## The zero-is-not-clean check
 *
 * The most important assertion here is check 1: **a ref with no analyses is not a clean ref.** That
 * is precisely the trap this gate was written after falling into — `alerts?state=open` returned `0`
 * for a ref CodeQL had never looked at, and "0 open alerts" reads exactly like "clean". A gate that
 * cannot tell those apart is worse than none, because it manufactures confidence.
 *
 * ## Two limitations, stated because they bound what a pass means
 *
 * 1. **The analysis lags the commit.** Alerts are keyed to a ref, not a commit, and CodeQL runs in
 *    parallel with CI. So the newest analysis for a ref can predate `HEAD`, and this gate then
 *    reports on the previous commit's code. The run below prints the analysis timestamp for exactly
 *    that reason — read it, do not assume it covers what you just wrote.
 * 2. **It is therefore NOT in CI.** On a fresh push CodeQL has usually not finished, so CI would
 *    fail on the previous commit's alerts — including ones the pushed commit fixes. A gate that
 *    goes red for work already done is a gate people learn to ignore. It runs in the phase gate,
 *    which is the sign-off path, and the honest cost is that it is not enforced per-push. Wiring it
 *    in properly means waiting on the CodeQL check to complete first, which is a CI change worth
 *    making deliberately rather than as a side effect of this step.
 *
 * ## Why it can be skipped, and why that is not a hole
 *
 * This gate reads GitHub state, not the working tree, so it needs `gh` and network access and is
 * not reproducible offline. `BETA_SKIP_CODE_SCANNING=1` exists for that, and it prints a loud
 * NOT RUN rather than a pass — the same distinction `verify-gate` draws for gates that were not
 * requested. CI never sets it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/code-scanning.mjs
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/code-scanning.mjs --json
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/code-scanning.mjs --today 2027-01-01   # test allowlist expiry
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/code-scanning.mjs --ref refs/heads/main  # test an unanalysed ref
 *   BETA_SKIP_CODE_SCANNING=1 node scripts/beta-harness/code-scanning.mjs
 *
 * Exit 1 on a high/critical alert, an unallowlisted or expired medium/low, a stale allowlist entry,
 * or a ref that has never been analysed. Exit 0 with a NOT RUN banner when skipped.
