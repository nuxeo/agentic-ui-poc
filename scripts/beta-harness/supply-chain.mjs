/**
 * Supply-chain gate — SCA with teeth, and a dependency-surface check.
 *
 * ## Why `npm audit` alone was not a gate
 *
 * The Beta checklist asks for SCA. What existed was a human running `npm audit` and writing the
 * number into a document — which is a measurement, not a gate. Three things were missing:
 *
 * 1. **Nothing failed.** A `high` appearing in a production dependency tomorrow would be recorded
 *    in the next document someone happened to write.
 * 2. **`npm audit` alone is the wrong denominator.** The full audit reports 9 high and 13 moderate;
 *    every one is in **dev** tooling that never reaches a customer. Gating on that total would be
 *    red permanently, and a gate that cannot pass gets bypassed and then ignored — the same
 *    reasoning behind the coverage ratchet. Gating on `--omit=dev` is the honest denominator, and
 *    the dev total is *reported* here so it cannot be quietly forgotten either.
 * 3. **Accepting a finding had no expiry.** "It's only a low" is a decision, and an undated
 *    decision becomes a permanent one. Allowlist entries need a reason and a date, and expire.
 *
 * ## The dependency-surface check
 *
 * The fourth check exists because of what it found: **four production dependencies that nothing
 * imported** — `openai`, `express`, `cors` and `dotenv`. Two were already recorded as debt; `cors`
 * and `dotenv` were not, and were found by this check.
 *
 * That is not tidiness. `openai` in `dependencies` is the single clearest reason a reader concludes
 * this application makes direct LLM calls — it does not; the AI features are Nuxeo Automation
 * operations — and every unused production dependency is audit surface, licence surface and
 * supply-chain surface for no benefit.
 *
 * The check needs an exception list because a package can be genuinely required and never appear in
 * an import: Angular's runtime needs `tslib` and `@angular/animations`, and seven packages exist
 * only to pin versions that `@alfresco/adf-core` requires as peers or dependencies. Every exception
 * carries a reason, and an exception that stops being needed fails the check as unnecessary — so
 * the list cannot rot into a place where things are hidden.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/supply-chain.mjs
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/supply-chain.mjs --json
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/supply-chain.mjs --today 2027-01-01   # test allowlist expiry
 *
 * Exit 1 on a production high/critical, an unallowlisted or expired production finding, an
 * unreferenced production dependency, an exception that is no longer needed, or an acceptance
 * whose cited mitigation no longer exists in the code it names.

/* ------------------------------------------- 5. the cited mitigations still exist ---- */

/**
 * Does the code an acceptance points at still exist, and does it still contain the guard?
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * An acceptance's prose carries its whole argument and nothing verified a word of it. The `quill`
 * entry has been re-reviewed four times and every pass found at least one source pointer stale —
 * naming an unrelated line, or sanitised code sitting in a branch the advisory cannot reach. By the
 * fifth review three of its four pointers had drifted again: the `DOMPurify` call it cited at
 * 502-503 had moved to 525-526, and 502 had become an unrelated method signature. `advisory` and
 * `affects` moved part of the entry's burden onto this gate; this moves the source pointers too.
 *
 * Line numbers are the part that rots, because they shift whenever anyone inserts a method above
 * them and nothing complains. So an entry cites a `declaration` — the literal text of the
 * declaration line — plus an optional `guard` that must appear inside that declaration's body.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT do
 *
 * It does not check that the claim is true. It checks that the code the claim names still exists
 * and still contains the mitigation it credits. A reviewer must still read the argument; what they
 * no longer have to do is work out whether the pointers were ever right in the first place.
 *
 * ## Why this parses instead of counting braces
 *
 * The first version of this check found the anchor with `indexOf`, matched braces by counting
 * them, and tested the guard with `includes` on the raw text. Review found two holes in it, and
 * the second was demonstrated rather than argued: **commenting out** `DOMPurify.sanitize(...)`
 * left the gate green, because the guard string was still present — in a comment. That is not a
 * contrived input, it is what removing a line during a refactor actually looks like, and it is
 * precisely the regression this check exists to catch. The first hole was the same shape: a `{`
 * inside a string literal unbalances a brace counter, so the "body" runs on past the end of the
 * function and an unrelated later occurrence of the guard satisfies it.
 *
 * So the file is parsed. The body comes from the AST, and the guard is matched against source
 * with comments and literals blanked out.
 *
 * ## Consequences worth knowing before you write an entry
 *
 * - **A `guard` must be executable code**, because the text it is matched against has string and
 *   template literals blanked. `expect(x).not.toContain(` is a usable guard; `'<script'` is not.
 * - **An anchor may contain a string literal** — `it('…', () => {` has to work — so anchors are
 *   matched against source with only comments blanked. An anchor therefore cannot resolve to a
 *   declaration quoted inside a doc comment, which matters in a repository whose comments quote
 *   code as often as this one's do.
 *
 * ## Fail-closed choices, each for a reason
 *
 * - The anchor must be UNIQUE in the file. A bare symbol name is not enough: `readQuillHtml`
 *   appears three times in note-editor.ts, twice as a call, so anchoring on the first occurrence
 *   would resolve a *caller's* body and hunt for the guard in the wrong function.
 * - An anchor that resolves to no function body fails rather than being skipped.
 * - `mitigations` is optional, exactly as `affects` is: an acceptance can legitimately rest on
 *   something with no code to point at. But a field that is PRESENT must be a non-empty array of
 *   usable entries, so it cannot quietly opt out of its own verification.
