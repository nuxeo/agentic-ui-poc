/**
 * Verify `.ai/state/phases.json` against the evidence actually on disk.
 *
 * This is the anti-false-completion control. Phase 1 was recorded complete — in
 * prose, in section 3 of `AGENTS/11-beta-program.md`, and used to downgrade a risk
 * — while its upgrade-safe config path was wrong by one segment and "would have
 * 404'd on every install". Nothing mechanically connected the claim to an artifact.
 *
 * Now a phase may be `complete` only if its cited manifest exists and says `pass`.
 * A missing manifest, a `fail`, a `precondition-not-met`, or a manifest with zero
 * checks all make the claim unsupported and this gate red.
 *
 * `manifest: "<phase-dir>/latest"` resolves to the newest timestamped run in that
 * directory, so the state file does not need editing after every capture. That is
 * deliberate: a stamp nobody updates becomes a lie quietly, whereas `latest`
 * degrades loudly the moment the newest run stops passing.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/state-check.mjs [--json]
 *
 * Exit 1 if any phase claims more than the evidence supports.
