/**
 * The upgrade rehearsal: install, customise, upgrade, and prove the customisation survived.
 *
 * `docs/adf-hx-beta-plan.md` Phase 6 calls this "the test that actually proves the model",
 * and it is the only check that speaks to the claim the whole four-layer contract rests on —
 * that **a customer upgrade is an `npm version` bump**. Every other gate tests one version
 * in isolation:
 *
 *   - `api-surface`    — has the published surface changed shape?
 *   - `publishability` — can the package be published, and do its declarations compile?
 *   - `fork-simulation`— does the template compile against ONE built version?
 *
 * None of them crosses a version boundary, so none of them can see the failure that
 * matters: an upgrade that compiles perfectly and silently drops the customer's
 * customisations.
 *
 * ## What a customer actually owns, and what must survive
 *
 * Three surfaces, taken from the reference customer in this repo rather than invented:
 *
 *   Layer 0  `public/agentic-ui-config/bootstrap.json`  theme, branding, languages
 *   Layer 1  `manifest.example.json`                    slot entries, overrides, IDs
 *   Layer 2  `libs/extensions/acme-extensions`          their own registered code
 *
 * ## The assertion that earns this script its place
 *
 * **Slot names and IDs are the upgrade contract.** The Layer 1 manifest is JSON: it names
 * `navbar`, `sidebar`, `toolbar`, and IDs like `template.actions.exportSummary`. Nothing
 * type-checks JSON. Rename a slot in the platform and every customer manifest referencing
 * it goes quietly inert — the app still boots, still compiles, and the customer's nav entry
 * is simply gone. That is the defect class this exists to catch, and it is invisible to a
 * compiler by construction.
 *
 * ## Honest limits
 *
 * The two versions differ only in their version string, because inventing API changes to
 * test against would be testing the invention. So this does not prove "any future upgrade
 * is safe" — nothing could. What it proves is that the *mechanism* holds and that the check
 * is **sensitive**: the negative control removes a slot id from the new package and this
 * script goes red. Run it with `--break-slot <name>` to see that for yourself.
 *
 * ## The result that justifies check 4c
 *
 * `--break-slot navbar` fails **both** the compile and the ID check, because the template
 * also writes `EXTENSION_SLOTS.navbar` in TypeScript. That case proves little: a compiler
 * would have caught it.
 *
 * `--break-slot toolbar` is the one that matters. `toolbar` is named in the JSON manifest
 * and referenced by **no** TypeScript in the customer's tree, so:
 *
 *     the customer app compiles against @nuxeo-satori/platform@0.2.0 (after the upgrade)
 *     upgrade-rehearsal: FAIL — 1 problem(s)
 *     - The manifest names 1 slot(s) the upgraded package no longer has: toolbar.
 *
 * A green compile and a broken customer. Check 4c is the only thing in the pipeline that
 * sees it — `api-surface` would notice the declaration changed, but that reads as "the
 * surface moved, update the snapshot", not "every manifest naming this slot is now inert".
 *
 * It is also static. It does not boot the app, so it cannot prove the nav entry renders —
 * `phase-6-a11y` and the evidence captures do that against a live server. This proves the
 * contract survives, not that the pixels arrive.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/upgrade-rehearsal.mjs
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/upgrade-rehearsal.mjs --break-slot navbar   # negative control

   * defect this repository has paid for more than once. What the check actually detected was
   * uncommitted work, which says nothing about an upgrade and turned the gate red for anyone
   * mid-change. It was noticed exactly that way, on the commit that added the E2E project.
   *
   * ## What survives an upgrade, and therefore what is worth asserting
   *
   * A deep import into platform internals. `@nuxeo-satori/platform/extensions` is supported
   * and will still resolve next version; a path into its guts is not, and is precisely what
   * breaks when the internals move — the failure this phase's claim depends on not
   * happening. So the staged customer tree is checked for specifiers outside the published
   * `exports` map, against the map of the **upgraded** package rather than a hardcoded list.
