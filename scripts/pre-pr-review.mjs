/**
 * The mechanisable part of a pre-PR review.
 *
 *   node scripts/pre-pr-review.mjs            # the whole working tree's changed files
 *   node scripts/pre-pr-review.mjs --base <ref>
 *   node scripts/pre-pr-review.mjs --all      # every file, not just the diff
 *
 * ## Why these checks and not others
 *
 * Built from the reviewer findings in docs/pr-review-findings.jsonl, classified by *why* they were
 * missed rather than what they were (see the PR Review analysis page). The distribution said
 * something useful: almost none were logic errors. In every case the author understood the
 * problem and wrote code that solved it, and what went wrong was the gap between what the
 * code does and what the author believed it does — invisible from the inside, because the
 * belief is what produced the code.
 *
 * So the checks worth automating are the ones that **compare two artifacts** rather than
 * inspect one. Three classes are mechanisable that way and are implemented here:
 *
 *   silent-failure    (5 findings) an error path that reports success
 *   broken-reference  (1)          a link or path that does not resolve
 *   false-claim       (4, partly)  docs naming a command or file that does not exist
 *
 * The other classes — `proxy-check` (15), `unenforced-guarantee` (12), `stale-prose` (9) —
 * need judgement and live in `.cursor/skills/pre-pr-review/SKILL.md`. They are the majority,
 * which is worth stating plainly: **a green run here is not a review.** It clears the floor
 * so a reader spends their attention on the three classes a grep cannot see.

 * One pass over the source producing two views, both the same length as the input so every

 *   `code`   strings, template literals **and** comments blanked — what patterns run against
 *   `prose`  strings blanked, comments kept — what the rationale check reads
 *
 * Two views rather than one because the two questions are opposites, and every version that
 * tried to answer both from a single string was wrong in one direction or the other:
 *
 * - Raw source flagged this file's own documentation, which names the swallow pattern as an
 *   example. A checker that fires on its own prose is one people switch off. → blank strings.
 * - An apostrophe in a comment is not a quote. `// don't discard this` opened a quoted region
 *   that ran to the end of the file and hid every subsequent defect — in most prose. → track
 *   comment state.
 * - Keeping comment text in the matched view reintroduced the first problem. → blank comments
 *   in `code`.
 * - Reading raw text for the rationale check then meant a `//` **inside a string** counted as
 *   a comment, so `fetch('https://example').catch(() => {})` was excused by its own URL.
 *   → give the rationale check `prose`, where that `//` is blanked and real comments are not.
 * - Every quote outside a comment was a string opener, but a regex literal can contain one:
 *   `const pattern = /isn't/;` opened a region that swallowed the next `.catch(() => {})`.
 *   This file is itself full of `/…['"]…/`, so the rule was blind to its own neighbourhood.
 *   → lex regex literals too.
 *
 * Whether `/` starts a regex or divides is not decidable from one character, so the usual
 * heuristic is used: it is a regex when the previous significant character is one that cannot
 * end an expression (`(,=:[!&|?{};` or a line start), or the previous word is `return`,
 * `typeof`, `case` or `in`. Division always follows a value, so the two do not overlap in
 * practice. Escapes and character classes are tracked, because `/[/]/` and `/\//` both
 * contain a `/` that does not close the literal.
