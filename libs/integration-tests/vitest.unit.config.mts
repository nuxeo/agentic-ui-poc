/**
 * The `test` target's config — the half of this library that needs no Nuxeo.
 *
 * ## Why there is a second config rather than a second glob
 *
 * `project.json` explains at length that the live target is called `integration`, not `test`,
 * so that no `-t test` invocation can reach specs requiring a server CI does not have. That
 * reasoning is intact and this config is what keeps it intact: the two `include` patterns are
 * **disjoint by construction**, not by an exclusion list someone has to remember to extend.
 *
 *   vitest.config.mts       ->  *.integration.spec.ts   live Nuxeo, `integration` target
 *   vitest.unit.config.mts  ->  *.unit.spec.ts          no Nuxeo,   `test` target
 *
 * A file cannot match both patterns, so a live spec cannot arrive in the `test` run by
 * accident of naming, and adding one to this run takes a rename that is visible in a diff.
 *
 * ## What earns a spec a place here
 *
 * `integration-preflight.ts` and `preflight-cli.ts` decide whether the suite is allowed to
 * run at all, and `preflight-cli.ts` decides with which exit code. Under the `integration`
 * target neither is ever exercised on CI — the target does not run there — so the gate that
 * guards the suite had nothing guarding it. Stubbing `fetch` tests the decision, not the
 * server, which is the line this library's audit draws: the harness's live halves are NOT
 * here, because mocking a `DELETE` against a real repository would test the mock.
 *
 * No `setupFiles`: `vitest.setup.ts` initialises Angular's TestBed for one live spec, and
 * nothing in the unit run has an Angular dependency to initialise.
