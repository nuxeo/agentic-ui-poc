/**
 * SearchService integration tests.
 *
 * Stage 5 of the integration-test plan: SearchService (839 lines) against live Nuxeo and
 * OpenSearch. The highest-risk gap per audit §6.1, §7.2.
 *
 * Tests:
 * - Fulltext search, quick filters, drawer filters
 * - Sorting, pagination
 * - Autocomplete suggestions
 * - Saved search CRUD
 * - Error handling
 *
 * ## Every assertion here is scoped to this run's own documents, deliberately
 *
 * Two measured properties of the deployment make an unscoped assertion worthless, and both
 * were what let ten of these tests pass while proving nothing:
 *
 * 1. **The search index on a shared instance is stale.** An unscoped `default_search` query
 *    reports `resultsCount` in the thousands and returns 0–7 resolvable rows, because the
 *    index still holds documents other worktrees have deleted. So `expect(items).toBeDefined()`
 *    and `expect(items.length).toBeGreaterThan(0)` are not the same assertion, and the first
 *    is satisfied by every broken query there is. Measured 2026-09-23: `sortBy=dc:created`
 *    `sortOrder=desc` → `resultsCount` 1026, `entries` 0.
 * 2. **`SearchQueryParams.q` does not filter.** It is sent as the `query` HTTP parameter, and
 *    `default_search` has no such predicate, so Nuxeo ignores it: `query=Searchable` and no
 *    query at all both answer `resultsCount` 1026 on the same repository. The page provider's
 *    fulltext parameter is `ecm_fulltext`, which `SearchQueryParams.ecmFulltext` sets. The
 *    tests below therefore scope with `ecmFulltext`. **`q` has no integration coverage here
 *    because there is no server behaviour to cover** — see the pull request; whether `q`
 *    should map to `ecm_fulltext` is a product decision, not a test fix.
 *
 * So `beforeAll` seeds five documents carrying a token unique to this run, waits for each to
 * be indexed, and every test asserts on *those* documents by UID. A test that can name the
 * rows it expects is a test that can fail.
 *
 * Acceptance criteria (from audit §11 Stage 5), and where each stands:
 * - Every public method exercised against the server — NOT met. `search`, `suggest`,
 *   `getUserCollections` and the four saved-search methods are; the rest of the service is not,
 *   and `q` cannot be (above).
 * - At least one 4xx and one 5xx tested — NOT met. See the note in `Error Handling` below.
 * - Reverting hxql-literal fix turns suite red — met, but **not here**. The guard lives in
 *   `apps/nuxeo-ui-e2e/src/search.spec.ts`, which drives the one page that composes HXQL.
 *   The block that used to stand in for it in this file could not fail; see below.
