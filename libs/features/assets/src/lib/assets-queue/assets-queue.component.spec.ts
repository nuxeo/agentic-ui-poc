/**
 * Covers the object-URL ledger, which is the only thing in this component that can misbehave silently.
 *
 * The effect that fetches thumbnails only ever ADDED: `objectUrls` and `thumbnailMap` kept every id
 * they had ever seen until `onDestroy`, and this queue stays mounted across searches. So every prior
 * result's thumbnail blob was retained for the lifetime of the page, growing without bound. The
 * per-id revoke-before-replace already there only covers re-fetching the *same* id; it never saw an id
 * that simply stopped being in the results.
 *
 * This is the first spec in the `assets` project, which had none — so `nx test assets` reported
 * success over zero coverage. The component it covers is a near-copy of `search-queue`, and it had
 * the identical defect; the two were fixed together.
 *
 * Create and revoke are asserted as a PAIR. Counting only creates cannot detect a leak, and counting
 * only revokes cannot detect over-revocation — the two failure modes are opposite and both matter.
