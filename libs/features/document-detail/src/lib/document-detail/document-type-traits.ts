 * Every decision document detail takes on a document's type, in one table.

 * Two kinds of decision live here, and they are kept apart on purpose:
 *
 * - **Which packaged piece renders the View tab** (`view`). This is the fallback the
 *   `documentView` slot sits in front of: a contributed entry whose rule admits the document wins,
 *   and when none does, or its component fails to load, the piece named here renders.
 * - **How the page loads and treats the content** (`picture`, `video`, `preview`), and the icon a
 *   type gets in the Publishing tab's section tree (`sectionIcon`). The fetches stay in the host;
 *   only the question "is this that type?" is answered here.
 *
 * Types match exactly, as Nuxeo type names are case-sensitive, and never through a parent: a
 * subtype of Picture takes the defaults, as it did when each check was an inline comparison.
