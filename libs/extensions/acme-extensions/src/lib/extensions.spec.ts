 * Proves this library actually registers what it claims to.
 *
 * Written against the **observable registry state**, not against the provider's
 * internals, because the failure worth catching is a library that declares
 * descriptors nothing renders. Asserting "the function was called" would not catch
 * it; asserting "the ID is in the registry" does.
 *
 * Keep these tests when you replace the generated contributions with your own —
 * change the expected IDs, not the shape of the assertions.
