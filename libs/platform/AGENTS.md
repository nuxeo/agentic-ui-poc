# AGENTS.md — extending Nuxeo Satori

**Audience:** a developer or an AI agent extending the platform from **outside** it.
**Scope:** everything you need to add a navigation entry, a rule, an action or a
component without forking us. Nothing here is about how the platform itself is built.

Read [`extension-reference.md`](./extension-reference.md) alongside this — it is the
list of every addressable ID. This file is the _procedure_; that file is the
_vocabulary_.

## 1. The rule that matters most

**Never fork to change something a layer already addresses.** In order of cost:

| Layer | You change                                            | Rebuild?   | Who can do it                             |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **0** | a `bootstrap` fragment — branding, theme, endpoints   | no         | whoever ships their configuration package |
| **1** | a `manifest` fragment — hide, reorder, relabel, gate  | no         | whoever ships their configuration package |
| **2** | your own npm library — new rules, actions, components | yes, yours | a developer                               |
| **3** | this file and the generators                          | —          | you, when extending                       |

If a change is possible at Layer 0 or 1, doing it in code is a mistake you will pay
for at the next upgrade. If it is not possible at any layer, that is a gap worth
raising rather than a reason to fork.

## 2. Start with a generator

The five generators ship **inside this package** — `generators.json` at its root, so Nx
resolves them from `node_modules` like any other plugin. Nothing to clone.

For Layer 0 and 1 — no code — scaffold the **configuration package** you install on Nuxeo:

```bash
npx nx g @nuxeo-satori/platform:config-package acme-config --owner=acme
npx nx build acme-config          # checks the fragments, writes dist/config-packages/acme-config/acme-config-1.0.0.zip
nuxeoctl mp-install dist/config-packages/acme-config/acme-config-1.0.0.zip   # then restart Nuxeo
```

It writes the Marketplace package — `package.xml` depending on `nuxeo-agentic-ui`, a component
that `<require>`s Satori's defaults, starter `bootstrap.json` and `manifest.json` with JSON
schemas for your editor — and a `build.mjs` that refuses what the server would reject (bad JSON,
a repeated key, a fragment over 1 MiB, a missing asset) before anything reaches a server.
`--presales` adds demo presets. Everything in a fragment is served without authentication.

Working from a clone of the Satori repository instead of the installed package? There
`generators.json` is a build output, so use `npx nx g ./tools/satori-generators:config-package acme-config --owner=acme`,
or run `npx nx run platform:sync-generators` once first.

For Layer 2 — code — the other four:

```bash
# once, per library
npx nx g @nuxeo-satori/platform:extension-library acme-extensions --owner=acme

# then, per contribution
npx nx g @nuxeo-satori/platform:extension-rule      is-legal-team --library=acme-extensions
npx nx g @nuxeo-satori/platform:extension-action    export-claim  --library=acme-extensions
npx nx g @nuxeo-satori/platform:extension-component claim-summary --library=acme-extensions
```

> These commands used to read `npx nx g ./tools/satori-generators:…` — a path inside the
> platform repository, which you do not have. The first instruction in this guide could not
> be run by its audience, and the generators were not in the tarball at all. Both fixed:
> `beta:publishable` now fails if any generator's factory or schema is missing from the
> built package.

`--library` takes the project name, and the library defaults to `libs/extensions/<name>`.
Pass `--directory` to place it elsewhere — note it is the **parent**, so
`--directory=libs/custom` yields `libs/custom/<name>`.

The library is **inert until an application opts in**. One line:

```ts
providers: [/* … */ provideAcmeExtensions()];
```

That is the whole integration. **No edit to any `@nuxeo-satori/platform` library** —
if you find yourself needing one, stop and raise it.

### The generators edit your `extensions.ts` through marker comments

```ts
    rules: {
      'acme.rules.canUseAcme': (context) => rules.canUseAcme(context),
      // satori:register:rules      <- keep this line
    },
```

Delete a marker and the matching generator fails loudly rather than guessing where to
insert. They are comments; they do nothing at runtime.

## 3. Four things that will bite you

### 3.1 An unregistered rule ID evaluates to `true`

Rules **fail open** by design, so a manifest typo cannot silently strip working
actions out of the interface. The consequence for you: a rule you have not registered
yet does not disable anything — it permits everything.

For a rule that _gates_ a surface, declare it fail-closed:

```ts
failClosedRules: ['acme.rules.isLegalTeam'];
```

The `extension-rule` generator does this by default, inverting the platform default
deliberately: a rule you are writing now is one you want closed while it is missing.

### 3.2 Inline slot literals do not compile

```ts
// ✗ TS2418 — excess property checking rejects label/path/icon
slots: {
  navbar: [{ id: 'acme.navbar.x', label: 'X', path: '/x', icon: 'folder' }];
}

// ✓ hoist to a typed const first
const NAV: readonly NavItemDescriptor[] = [
  { id: 'acme.navbar.x', label: 'X', path: '/x', icon: 'folder' },
];
slots: {
  navbar: NAV;
}
```

`slots` values are typed `readonly ExtensionElement[]`, which carries only `id`,
`disabled` and `order` — the fields the registry honours for _every_ slot. A fresh
object literal gets excess property checking; an already-typed array does not. Hoisting
also documents which fields a slot expects.

### 3.3 A registered component is not a _placed_ component

Registering `acme.panel.claims` makes it addressable. Nothing renders until a manifest
places it, or a host route resolves it:

```ts
{ path: 'claims', component: ExtensionOutletComponent,
  data: { componentId: 'acme.panel.claims' } }
```

Do **not** export your component from `index.ts`. A host that can import the class
depends on a name that should stay free to change; it resolves by ID instead.

The `routes` slot is declared but **nothing resolves it** — a library cannot contribute
a route on its own, so a host must map the path. Check the slot table in
`extension-reference.md` before assuming a slot is live: it distinguishes _populated_,
_resolves_, and _reserved and inert_, and those are three different promises.

### 3.4 Hiding a control is not a security control

Layer 1 decides what the interface **offers**. Nuxeo decides what the server
**allows**, server-side, on every operation. Hiding a delete action does not stop a
user with `Remove` from deleting over REST, and showing it grants nothing.
`failClosedRules` closes a startup-timing gap in the _interface_; it is not
authorisation either. Use Nuxeo ACLs.

## 4. How to verify your library — and how not to

```bash
npx nx test <library>       # asserts your IDs are really registered
npx nx typecheck <library>  # `test` does NOT typecheck — vitest strips types
npx nx lint <library>
```

`typecheck` is not redundant. Vitest strips types through esbuild, so a green `test`
says nothing about type safety.

### Run the shipped guardrail in your own CI

Those three targets check that your code compiles and that your own assertions hold. They
cannot tell you that you have made one of the five mistakes below, because each one is
green code. This package ships the check as an executable:

```bash
node node_modules/@nuxeo-satori/platform/guardrails/check-extension-library.mjs libs/<your-library>
```

It exits non-zero on: an ID registered under a prefix you do not own, an import that
reaches past a published entry point, a library with no spec touching a registry, a
gating rule missing from `failClosedRules`, a component exported from your barrel, and a
**component contribution** that does not hold up — see §7. Every one of those corresponds to
a mistake made in this codebase, not a hypothetical — and every one passes `lint`, `test` and
`typecheck`.

We run it against our own reference library on every build, so you are not the first to
find out when it breaks.

### Assert against the registry, not against your own call

The failure this contract exists to prevent is a library that registers descriptors
nothing renders. Only the registry can tell you the difference:

```ts
// ✓ observable registry state
expect(TestBed.inject(ExtensionActionRegistry).has('acme.actions.export')).toBe(true);

// ✗ proves only that you called a function
expect(provideSpy).toHaveBeenCalled();
```

**And assert a rule's answer as `false`, not `true.`** An _unregistered_ ID also
evaluates to `true`, so a test expecting `true` passes whether or not your registration
happened. Only `false` is an answer a genuinely registered evaluator can give.

This is not hypothetical. Three generators in this workspace once spliced every
registration _inside a comment_, reported success, printed the IDs they had
"registered" — and `lint`, `typecheck` and six existing specs all passed, because none
of them named the new IDs.

## 5. If you are an AI agent

- **Do not edit anything under `@nuxeo-satori/platform`.** If a task seems to require
  it, the task is either a Layer 0/1 change in disguise or a genuine gap to report.
- **Prefer a generator to hand-writing a file.** They emit the specs and the guard
  rails; hand-written contributions routinely omit both.
- **An ID is a public contract.** Once a manifest references it, renaming is breaking.
  Use your own `<owner>.` prefix for everything you contribute.
- **Never claim a contribution works because it compiled.** Run the specs, and make one
  of them assert registry state. A green build is compatible with registering nothing.
- **State what you did not verify.** "Registered and typechecks" and "renders on
  screen" are different claims.

## 6. Where things live

| What                                             | Where                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Every addressable ID, and each slot's real state | `extension-reference.md`                                                                      |
| The published API surface                        | `@nuxeo-satori/platform` type declarations                                                    |
| Entry points                                     | `@nuxeo-satori/platform/{extensions,app-config,components,components-satori,nuxeo-client,ui}` |
| Your contributions                               | your own library, `provideSatoriExtensions()`                                                 |

## 7. The `nxs-` components — compose, override, place

`@nuxeo-satori/platform/components` is the Nuxeo-owned component library: `nxs-` selectors,
built on Angular Material, with no ADF and no Satori import of its own. There are three things
you can do with it, and they are different promises.

### Composable — use a component inside your own

Every component the entry point exports can be imported and used in your Layer 2 components:

```ts
import { NxsEmptyStateComponent } from '@nuxeo-satori/platform/components';
```

```html
<nxs-empty-state icon="inbox" [heading]="'acme.claims.empty' | translate" />
```

- **Text inputs take text you have already translated.** The library ships no catalogue, so
  bind every heading, message and label through your own translate pipe. A composite component
  such as `nxs-permissions-panel` translates its own chrome under `satori-components.*`; the
  package's English for those keys is served by `providePlatformEnglishFallback()`.
- **`nxs-empty-state` renders its heading as an `<h2>` by default.** Bind `[headingLevel]` to
  one below the heading of the section it sits in, so screen-reader heading navigation stays in
  order.
- **Import only the entry point.** A path past it fails the shipped guardrail like any other
  deep import.
- **The type declarations are the list of what exists.** Do not take a component's existence
  from this file; each one also has a story in the library's Storybook.

### Overridable — re-register an ID

Two kinds of ID are addressable, so you can replace what renders under them without forking.

**A packaged panel.** `nxs-permissions-panel` is registered as `NXS_PERMISSIONS_PANEL_ID`
(`nxs.components.permissionsPanel`). Register your own component under it and both Permissions
tabs render yours, with `documentId` and `permissionsChanged`, a callback to invoke after a write
so the host re-reads the external-user section it owns.

**The four primitives**, each with a Material and a Satori implementation:

| ID                           | Contract to implement  | Material, from `/components` | Satori, from `/components-satori` |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `nxs.primitives.avatar`      | `NxsAvatarInputs`      | `nxs-avatar`                 | `sat-avatar`                      |
| `nxs.primitives.breadcrumbs` | `NxsBreadcrumbsInputs` | `nxs-breadcrumbs`            | `sat-breadcrumbs`                 |
| `nxs.primitives.tag`         | `NxsTagInputs`         | `nxs-tag`                    | `sat-category-tag`                |
| `nxs.primitives.richTooltip` | `NxsRichTooltipInputs` | `nxs-rich-tooltip`           | `sat-rich-tooltip`                |

`provideNxsComponents()` registers them on Material. Only with GitHub Packages access, add
`provideNxsSatoriComponents()` from `@nuxeo-satori/platform/components-satori` after it to
re-register them on Satori — the one entry point that needs the optional
`@hylandsoftware/satori-ui` peer. Registrations layer in provider order and later wins, so yours
goes last:

```ts
providers: [
  provideNxsComponents(),
  provideNxsSatoriComponents(), // optional
  provideSatoriExtensions({
    components: {
      'nxs.primitives.tag': () => import('./acme-tag').then((m) => m.AcmeTagComponent),
    },
  }),
];
```

**Implement the contract** — `class AcmeTagComponent implements NxsTagInputs` — because a host
passes that interface's inputs and the outlet silently drops any your component does not declare.
The shipped guardrail fails an override that does not.

**What overriding does not reach:** a component used **by class** rather than resolved by ID. An
override changes every place that renders the ID through `lib-extension-outlet`, and nothing that
composed `NxsTagComponent` directly. Today no packaged screen resolves the four primitive IDs yet — see
`extension-reference.md` §6a for where they do render.

### Placeable — the slots that render a component by ID

Four slots name a component with `componentId`, so a manifest can put a registered component on
screen with no build: `sidebar`, `tabs`, `documentView` and `routes`. `documentView` also passes
the focused document as a `document` input. Their state and descriptor fields are in
`extension-reference.md` §2, §6, §9, §9a and §11.

```json
{
  "extensions": {
    "slots": { "tabs": [{ "id": "acme.tabs.claims", "componentId": "acme.panel.claims" }] }
  }
}
```

### What the guardrail checks about a component you contribute

`check-extension-library.mjs` (§4) fails a component registration that:

- **does not resolve** — an `import()` path that is not a file in your library, or a class name
  the file does not export. The registry swallows a failed load, so this is otherwise a blank
  slot with no error anywhere;
- **no spec names** — by its ID, the key expression it is registered under, or its class;
- **uses another prefix's selector** — yours is `<owner>-`; `nxs-`, `lib-`, `app-` and `sat-`
  belong to the platform and collide on an upgrade;
- **overrides an `nxs.primitives.*` ID without implementing its contract**, or one that does not
  exist.
