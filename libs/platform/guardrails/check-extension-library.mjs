/**
 * Guardrails for a **customer** Satori extension library.
 *
 * Ships inside `@nuxeo-satori/platform` so a customer can run it against their own
 * library in their own CI:
 *
 *   node node_modules/@nuxeo-satori/platform/guardrails/check-extension-library.mjs <dir>
 *
 * ## Why this is not our own guardrail script
 *
 * `scripts/review-guardrails.mjs` in the platform repository checks *our* invariants —
 * theme tokens, blob-URL lifecycles, adf-hx markers, evidence rules. None of that
 * applies to a customer, and it is a gate step in our own pipeline, so reshaping it to
 * serve two audiences would put a customer-facing concern on the critical path of our
 * build. This is a separate script with different checks and a different target.
 *
 * ## What it checks, and why each one exists
 *
 * Every check here corresponds to a mistake that has actually been made in this
 * codebase, not a hypothetical:
 *
 * 1. **Every registered ID carries the library's own owner prefix.** An ID is a public
 *    contract; borrowing the platform's `app.` prefix means a platform upgrade can
 *    collide with you.
 * 2. **No import reaches past a published entry point.** `@nuxeo-satori/platform/extensions`
 *    is supported; a deep path into its internals is not, and will break without being
 *    a breaking change.
 * 3. **A specs file asserts registry state.** A library whose tests never touch the
 *    registries can register nothing and stay green — three generators in this
 *    workspace did exactly that, spliced inside a comment, while lint, typecheck and
 *    six specs all passed.
 * 4. **Rules that gate a surface are declared fail-closed.** An unregistered rule ID
 *    evaluates to `true`; a gating rule that is missing therefore permits everything.
 * 5. **No component is exported from the barrel.** A host that can import the class
 *    depends on a name that should stay free to change.
 *
 * Exit code 0 = pass, 1 = at least one failure. Warnings do not fail.
