 * ## Why this is an effect rather than a one-shot
 *
 * The manifest lives in a Nuxeo document and is fetched **after** sign-in — see
 * `provideManifestRefresh` — so at the moment `provideRouter()` builds the
 * config there is nothing to contribute yet. Re-resolving on the manifest signal
 * is what makes a manifest-declared route exist for the session that loaded it,
 * rather than only for the next full page load.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * Descriptors are resolved against an **empty rule context**. A `rule` on a
 * route would otherwise be evaluated once, at registration, against whatever
 * happened to be in focus then — an answer that would look like authorisation
 * and be nothing of the kind. Use `disabled`, or a `visible: false` override, to
 * withdraw a route.
 *
 * A route contributed here carries **no guard**, and adding one from a manifest
 * is not offered. Nuxeo evaluates permissions server-side; a page reachable by
 * URL is not a page whose data the user may read.
 *
 * The registration is late by construction, so a deep link typed before the
 * manifest has loaded does not match. The route works from the moment the
 * manifest arrives; it is not a substitute for a compiled-in route.
