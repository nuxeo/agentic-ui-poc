 * their handlers. Anything marked `nxsFolderHeaderDetail` — a breadcrumb trail, say — is
 * projected under the title instead. On a narrow screen the actions drop below the title.
 *
 * The title is the page's level-one heading unless `headingLevel` says otherwise; omit it (blank)
 * while the container is loading rather than announce an empty heading.
