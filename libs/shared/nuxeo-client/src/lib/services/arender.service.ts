 * **Every method must answer for an absent configuration.** `ARENDER_CONFIG` is `null` whenever
 * `integrations.arender` is not set in the Layer 0 bootstrap file, which is the default for every
 * deployment in this repository. Before the guards below existed, `null` produced a
 * `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null` in all three methods — and the reason nobody noticed
 * is worth keeping:
 *
 *   - `isAvailable` raised its `TypeError` *inside* an Observable subscriber, so RxJS converted it
 *     to an error notification, and `document-detail`'s `error:` handler set the URL to `null`.
 *     The UI therefore reached "Annotations are not available" — the right outcome, produced by a
 *     swallowed type error rather than by a decision.
 *   - `getPreviewerUrl` threw *synchronously*, which no `error:` handler can catch. It was
 *     unreachable only because `isAvailable` errored first and `switchMap` never ran.
 *
 * So the correct behaviour was one refactor away from an unhandled exception, and `typecheck`
 * could not see it: Angular types `useFactory` as `(...args: any[]) => any`, so a provider handing
 * `null` to a non-nullable token compiles clean.

  /**
   * The configuration, or `null` if it is absent, **incomplete**, or **not safe to navigate**.
   *
   * This is the single choke point for ARender's trust decision, and it fails closed. Three things
   * disqualify a configuration:
   *
   * **1. Absent.** `integrations.arender` defaults to `null`.
   *
   * **2. A blank endpoint** — worse than `null`, because `fetch('')` resolves against the
   * *application's own* origin, so `isAvailable()` would report a viewer as present. It would also
   * allow-list this application's own origin in `framableOrNull`, which is the more dangerous half:
   * a same-origin URL in the response body would then be framed and trusted.
   *
   * This check is now **defence in depth for direct providers**, not a patch over the layer below.
   * It was written when `bootstrap-config.ts`'s `mergeIntegrations` carried the comment "Both
   * endpoints are required: half an ARender configuration is worse than none" without enforcing it,
   * so a bootstrap file naming only `viewerOrigin` produced `nuxeoInternalUrl: ''`. That was fixed
   * in this same change: `completeARenderConfig` returns `null` unless the merged result has both
   * endpoints non-blank, so the bootstrap path can no longer deliver this state. Anything providing
   * `ARENDER_CONFIG` directly — a test, or a custom provider in an app config — still can, which is
   * why the guard stays. Describing it as compensating for the bootstrap layer would be describing
   * code that no longer runs.
   *
   * **3. A `viewerOrigin` that is not an http(s) origin.** This is the one that matters most.
   * `viewerOrigin` is the allow-list deciding which origin may be bypassed and loaded into an
   * `iframe`, and the manifest it comes from is a *customer-editable* surface. A manifest setting
   * it to `javascript:alert(1)` is complete, non-blank and well-formed — `new URL()` accepts
   * `javascript:` without complaint — so nothing above catches it, and the result is script
   * execution in this application's origin from a configuration value. `https:` is required unless
   * `isDevMode()`, because a plaintext document in an iframe is a downgrade.
   *
   * Enforcing all three here means no caller can build a dangerous URL in the first place; the
   * bypass in `document-detail` validates again before trusting, because defence for a privilege
   * boundary should not rest on one function.

   * accepted residual risk on the Category C bypass. Since `viewerOrigin` is no longer needed to
   * *build* anything, it can pay for itself as the allow-list instead, which closes that gap.
   *
   * Note `origin` discards any path: a `viewerOrigin` of `https://host/arender` allow-lists the
   * whole of `https://host`, not just `/arender`. `isNavigableBaseUrl` in `cfg` already refuses a
   * query, fragment or userinfo on that value, so the widening is limited to the path — acceptable,
