 * identifier whether or not we know it. Handing an unknown identifier to ngx-translate returns
 * the key itself, so a custom permission would render as `permissions.right.CustomFromMarketplace`
 * in the table. Checking membership first keeps the existing behaviour — unknown permissions show
 * their raw Nuxeo name, which is at least meaningful to an administrator.
