# Beta Program — Nuxeo Satori Component Platform

Context every agent needs before doing Beta work. Read this **after** `AGENTS.md`
and alongside `AGENTS/00-architecture.md`.

**RFC:** "RFC: Nuxeo Satori Beta - Component Platform and Customer Extensibility Model"
**Tickets:** NXENG-619 (Discovery) under NXENG-615 (Epic)
**Harness:** `scripts/beta-harness/` · **Entry skill:** `beta-phase`

## 1. What we are building, in one paragraph

A deep core ECM slice — browse, folder tree, search, document detail, metadata,
permissions, versions, upload and CRUD — built on real `adf-hx` components and
made customisable through a four-layer extensibility contract. Workflow, users
and groups, administration and publishing are **out of scope for Beta**.

The governing principle: **the extension contract is the product; AI agents are
the accelerator.** Customers customise through a documented, versioned API. They
do not edit our source, and neither do their agents.

## 2. The four layers

| Layer                  | Surface                                                                 | Customer writes     | Build needed       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| 0 — Configuration      | Theme tokens, nav items, action visibility, presets, labels             | JSON, CSS variables | No                 |
| 1 — Declarative wiring | Manifest references components, rules, actions, routes by registered ID | JSON                | No                 |
| 2 — Customer code      | New components, actions, rules, guards in their own library             | TypeScript          | Yes, in their repo |
| 3 — Agent harness      | Knowledge base, generators, runnable guardrails                         | Prompts             | Yes, in their repo |

When implementing anything, ask which layer it belongs to. Behaviour that a
manifest can express must not be hardcoded; behaviour that needs code must not
be faked in configuration.

## 3. Verified facts — do not re-litigate these

These were established by first-hand inspection of the published artifact.
Treat them as settled; if you contradict one, prove it first.

- **CI runs on this branch and passes.** `ci.yml` triggers on `push` as well as on
  `pull_request`, so a long-lived feature branch is validated without a PR. Run
  32480243192 is `completed success` on Node 20. Two phase reviews disagreed about
  this — one claimed "CI has still never run against it" — and the claim that it had
  run was the correct one. No pull request has been opened, so only the PR-triggered
  path is unexercised.
- **`SATORI_GH_READONLY_TOKEN` is set as a repository secret**, since 2026-08-03,
  and `read:packages` resolves both `@alfresco` and `@hylandsoftware`. The plan's
  open `token-request` item is closed for CI. Statements that the secret was never
  provisioned are stale.
- **Only a CI run is authoritative.** Local gates here run on Node 25 with a
  `--no-experimental-webstorage` workaround; the repo pins Node 20 and CI uses it.
  A local green is necessary, not sufficient.

  **So check it, every time you push.** This rule was stated here and then broken over
  twenty consecutive pushes while "CI green" was reported from local gates alone; CI was
  red for sixteen of those runs. The push does not tell you:

  ```bash
  gh run list --branch feature/adf-hx-browse-poc --limit 3 \
    --json status,conclusion,headSha,event
  ```

  Note that `concurrency.cancel-in-progress` is on, so pushing again **cancels** the
  previous run. A `cancelled` conclusion on an earlier commit is expected, not a failure —
  but it also means only the newest run has actually verified anything.

- `@alfresco/adf-hx-content-services` **is installable** with a `read:packages`
  token. 648 published versions. `latest` = `7.20.0-automate.292`,
  `beta` = `7.21.0-automate.86`.
- **There has been no stable release in twelve months.** The last true stable,
  `7.19.5`, is from August 2025 with an Angular 15 baseline. We pin an exact
  prerelease, never a dist-tag.
- adf-hx exposes **twelve API ports as overridable injection tokens** —
  `CHECKIN`, `COPY`, `DOCUMENT`, `DOWNLOAD`, `GROUP`, `MODEL`, `MOVE`, `QUERY`,
  `RENDITIONS`, `UPLOAD`, `USER`, `VERSION` — plus the aggregate
  `ADF_HX_CONTENT_SERVICES_API_PROVIDERS`. This is the substitution point the
  whole plan rests on.
- Its **dependency contract is under-declared**: one peer declared
  (`@angular/core >=19.2.9`) and one runtime dependency (`tslib`) against thirteen
  packages actually imported. We maintain the true pin set ourselves. Counted from
  the `7.20.0-automate.292` tarball, the load-bearing ones by import count are
  `@hylandsoftware/hxcs-js-client` (151), `@alfresco/adf-core` (66), `@ngx-translate/core`
  (48), `@alfresco/adf-extensions` (13) and `@alfresco/js-api` (2), plus seven
  `@angular/material` entry points and `@angular/cdk/collections`. **`npm install`
  brings none of them and warns about none of them** — a missing pin surfaces as a
  build error, not a dependency error, so budget Phase 3's spike for resolving the
  set by hand.
- `@alfresco/adf-extensions@9.0.0` is on **public npm**, runtime dependency
  `tslib` only, and is **installed and in use** as of Phase 2. Layers 0 and 1 need
  no privileged access. Three corrections established by installing it:
  - It declares three peers but its public `.d.ts` also imports
    `@angular/material/menu` and `@angular/router`, so it is **under-declared in
    the same way adf-hx is**. A second data point for R2, not a one-off.
  - Its shipped `index.d.ts` does **not** typecheck under `skipLibCheck: false` —
    six intrinsic `TS2411` index-signature errors, independent of missing peers.
    Consuming it requires `skipLibCheck: true`, which this repo already sets.
  - `@alfresco/js-api` is a mandatory peer but a **types-only** import: the
    runtime `.mjs` never references it. It is therefore a devDependency here, so
    a 7 MB Alfresco Content Services REST client does not ship inside a Nuxeo
    product to satisfy a compile-time constraint.
- **adf-extensions' `RuleContext` is Alfresco-domain-shaped** (`NodeEntry`,
  `SiteEntry`, `RepositoryInfo`), describing a repository we do not talk to. Our
  rule context is our own, in upstream's _shape_ but not its types; reusing
  upstream's would put ACS types in the signature every customer rule is written
  against. Its domain-neutral parts — `mergeObjects`, `mergeArrays`,
  `filterEnabled`, `sortByOrder`, `getValue` — are used directly.
- **One registry serves every `@alfresco` package we need.** `@alfresco:registry`
  points at GitHub Packages, and all four — `adf-extensions`, `js-api`,
  `adf-core` and `adf-hx-content-services` — download from it. Verified twice by
  fetching the tarballs with only that mapping present. adf-extensions, adf-core
  and js-api are _also_ on public npm, which makes a two-registry split look
  necessary; it is not. **Do not repoint this scope at public npm** — adf-hx is
  GitHub-Packages-exclusive and Phase 3 would break.
- Because `@alfresco/adf-extensions` is now a production dependency, CI requires
  `SATORI_GH_READONLY_TOKEN` to carry `read:packages` for the **Alfresco** org,
  not only `@hylandsoftware`.
- **`.npmrc` alone does not decide where CI fetches from — `package-lock.json`
  does.** `npm ci` installs from each entry's `resolved` URL and ignores the
  registry mapping. After changing a scope's registry you must regenerate the
  lock, or CI will keep fetching from the old host and any claim about token
  scope is untested.
- **Never run a bare `npm install` on macOS and commit the lockfile.** It prunes
  optional platform entries that Linux needs — `@oxc-resolver/binding-wasm32-wasi`'s
  nested `@emnapi/core` and `@emnapi/runtime` at 1.11.2 — and `npm ci` on the
  Linux runner then refuses the whole tree. This broke CI for the length of
  Phase 2. `--os`/`--cpu` do not restore them; recover by restoring a known-good
  lock and merging only the new entries in.
- **Layer 1 slots are additive by construction.** `ExtensionSlotRegistry` keys
  slots by opaque string with no enum, union or `switch` on slot identity, so a
  ninth slot requires no change to the eight. Do not introduce a central slot
  dispatch; it would undo the property the Beta addressable-surface decision
  rests on. `rules` was removed from `EXTENSION_SLOTS`: rules are not descriptors
  and live in `ExtensionRuleRegistry`, so `slots.rules` was silently inert.
- **A slot id existing does not mean anything reads it.** The principle stands; the
  inventory below it was **wrong about `documentList` from Phase 3 onwards** and is
  corrected here. `documentList` is registered with twelve packaged columns in
  `provide-app-extensions.ts` and resolved by **both** browse routes. `navbar` and
  `bulk-actions` have packaged descriptors and a host; `sidebar` is resolved but has no
  packaged descriptor; `routes`, `toolbar`, `contextMenu` and `tabs` are reserved and
  nothing reads them. Do not describe a reserved id as an extension point — and do not
  trust this list either: `npm run beta:reference` checks every slot-state claim in
  `docs/extension-reference.md` against the source, which is why the drift was found. A
  hand-maintained inventory in a "do not re-litigate" section is the worst place for a
  fact that changes every phase.
- **An unregistered rule id fails open, except for a declared list.** A manifest
  naming a rule this build does not have leaves the entry visible; Layer 1
  visibility is not an authorisation boundary, and failing closed would let a
  typo strip working actions out of the UI. `SECURITY_RELEVANT_RULE_IDS` — the
  three user rules, including `app.rules.hasAdministrationAccess` — fail
  **closed** instead. The list is declared rather than attached at registration,
  because the unsafe window is exactly the one before registration happens: that
  rule is contributed by the shell's `APP_INITIALIZER`, so any consumer resolving
  the navbar earlier saw an unknown id and got `true`, which would have offered
  Administration to every user. `rule: null` still ungates deliberately.
- **`core.not` is NOR, not NAND.** Upstream is `args.every(arg => !evaluator(...))`.
  Phase 2 shipped `!args.every(evaluator)`, which agrees for one argument and
  diverges from two upwards while the file claimed ACA parity. Corrected, with a
  multi-argument test.
- **The rule context has three independently populated halves.** `document` is
  written by document detail alone and cleared on destroy, so the seven document
  rules answer `false` on every other surface. `selectionCount` is populated from
  `SelectionService`, so the cardinality rules are live. `selection` — the
  documents — is **still empty**, because `SelectionService` tracks ids, so
  `canWriteSelection` and `canRemoveSelection` still answer `false`. Do not
  collapse `selectionCount` into `selection.length`; that is what keeps the
  distinction honest.
- **~~No library under `libs/` has a `build` target~~ — superseded by Phase 4.**
  `libs/platform` and `libs/shared/util` both have one today. The original fact was
  true when written and the _reason_ still holds:
  `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries`'s `enforceBuildableLibDependency` forbids a buildable
  library importing a non-buildable one, so a `build` target cascades through the
  dependency chain. Phase 4 resolved it the other way — `libs/platform` is a
  single buildable package whose four secondary entry points point _at_ the shared
  library sources, so nothing under `libs/shared/` needs a target of its own.
  `typecheck` remains the per-library gate, and still catches what `test` cannot.
- **`libs/platform/tsconfig.lib.json` is the _entire_ compiler configuration for the
  published package, not a set of overrides.** `@nx/angular:package` given a `tsConfig`
  option calls `parseRemappedTsConfigAndMergeDefaults`, which despite its name merges
  eight hardcoded options and otherwise **replaces** ng-packagr's bundled
  `conf/tsconfig.ngc.json`. Anything that file does not restate is lost, and Angular's own
  defaults are not the library-appropriate ones. This has produced two separate defects,
  both configuration _absent_ rather than wrong, so no compiler reported either:
  - omitting `strict` shipped 27 wrongly non-nullable public types;
  - omitting `compilationMode: "partial"` made the package **unpublishable** —
    ng-packagr writes a `prepublishOnly` that hard-fails `npm publish` for a full-mode
    build — for the whole of Phase 4, while the phase claimed an upgrade is an
    `npm version` bump.

  `npm run beta:publishable` runs a real `npm publish --dry-run` and is the only check
  that executes `prepublishOnly`. If you touch that tsconfig, run it.

- **A `depConstraints` of `sourceTag: '*' → onlyDependOnLibsWithTags: ['*']` enforces
  nothing.** That was Nx's scaffolded default and sat in `eslint.config.mjs` at severity
  `error` for the whole programme without rejecting a single edge, while CLAUDE.md listed
  "never cross-feature imports" as non-negotiable. Four violations accumulated. Real
  constraints are in place now, and **an untagged project cannot depend on anything** — a
  new library needs `scope:` and `type:` tags before it can import.
- **`npm ci` is not what catches a macOS-pruned lockfile.** `npm ci --dry-run`
  only demands the entries the current platform resolves, so on macOS it never
  looks at the pruned Linux subtree and passes. The `lockfile` gate checks the
  invariant directly: every non-optional dependency edge in the lock must resolve
  within the lock. It is the first gate because it is the failure the other five
  structurally cannot see.
- **The `test` gate does not typecheck.** Vitest transpiles through esbuild, so two
  real type errors in Phase 2 code passed 46 green unit tests and were caught only
  by `build`. Never treat a green `test` gate as evidence that types are sound.
- The marketplace installer copies the web directory with `overwrite="true"`, so
  **configuration inside the bundle is destroyed on upgrade**.
- The POC's bridge tokens (`DOCUMENT_API_TOKEN`, `QUERY_API_TOKEN`,
  `ROOT_DOCUMENT`, `DEFAULT_REPOSITORY_ID`) are local clones of published
  exports. Migration is to import upstream's and delete the clones.
- **Adopting `HxpDocumentListComponent` is API-port work, not a component swap, and
  the chain is now measured rather than estimated.** Attempting the swap on this
  branch compiles and typechecks, then fails at runtime with
  `NG0201: No provider found for DocumentService. Path: DocumentCacheService ->
DocumentService`. The chain, read from the published bundle:
  - the component does `inject(DocumentCacheService)` and
    `inject(ContextMenuActionsService)`, both **non-optionally**, so neither can be
    avoided — including by setting `[contextMenuActions]="false"`, which only
    changes rendering;
  - `DocumentCacheService` is `providedIn: 'root'` but injects upstream's
    `DocumentService`, which is **not** `providedIn` anything and must be provided;
  - `DocumentService`'s constructor requires three tokens — `DOCUMENT_API_TOKEN`,
    `QUERY_API_TOKEN` and `VERSION_API_TOKEN`, none optional — plus copy, move,
    create-version and restore-version services;
  - `ContextMenuActionsService` is also not `providedIn` anything and takes ten
    action handlers; `CONTEXT_MENU_ACTIONS_PROVIDERS` supplies nine of them.

  `ADF_HX_NUXEO_BRIDGE_PROVIDERS` binds `NuxeoDocumentApi` and `NuxeoQueryApi` to the
  bridge's **clone** tokens, so upstream's `DocumentService` cannot see them.
  **`VERSION_API_TOKEN` has no implementation at all** — manage-versions is a
  capability the POC lacks — so no amount of rebinding makes the swap work. Implement
  and bind the three ports first; the component swap is the small part that follows.

- **The two document lists are not interchangeable.** The hand-written
  `hxp-document-list` is 384 lines and renders an error state with retry, a card view,
  thumbnails and its own column picker. Upstream's renders a DataTable and nothing
  else: its inputs are `documents`, `isLoading`, `multiselect`, `contextMenuActions`
  and `schema`, and it emits `selectedDocuments`, `rowClicked`, `sortingClicked` and
  `columnsResized`. Those four capabilities must be rehomed to the host page, not
  dropped. `PACKAGED_BROWSE_COLUMNS` maps cleanly onto upstream's `[schema]` as
  `DataColumn[]`, so Layer 1 can drive the real DataTable without a second column list.
- **The published packages are compiled against Angular 19.2.18**, per the
  `ɵɵngDeclareFactory` metadata, while this repo runs 20.3.27. It compiles and builds;
  treat any partial-compilation oddity as a candidate cause before blaming our code.
- **The full provider chain for `HxpDocumentListComponent` is six API ports, not three,
  and it was walked to the end.** `DOCUMENT`, `QUERY` and `VERSION` are
  `DocumentService`'s own constructor tokens. Then `COPY` and `MOVE` arrive through its
  `SingleItemCopyService` and `SingleItemMoveService`, `CHECKIN` through its
  `CreateDocumentVersionService`, and `DOWNLOAD` through the context-menu handlers'
  `FileDownloadService -> SingleFileDownloadService -> BlobDownloadService`. Every link
  is non-optional. `[contextMenuActions]="false"` does **not** avoid the handler chain —
  `ContextMenuActionsService` constructs its handlers eagerly and that input only
  controls rendering. All six are thin over existing `nuxeo-client` methods:
  `VersionApi` declares one method, `CopyApi` and `MoveApi` one each, and
  `DocumentDetailService` already had `restoreVersion`, `fetchBlobByXpath`,
  `copyDocuments` and `moveDocuments`. Only `CHECKIN` needed a new service method.
- **`providedIn: 'root'` upstream decides where our providers must live.**
  `DocumentCacheService` is root-provided, so it resolves `DocumentService` from the
  root injector and cannot see component providers — providing `DocumentService` on the
  POC component leaves `NG0201` unchanged. Providing `DocumentCacheService` **itself**
  on the component shadows the root default and the whole chain then resolves locally.
  Prefer that to registering in `app.config.ts`, which also works and costs the initial
  bundle dearly (see below).
- **adf-core's `TranslationService` does not use the ngx-translate loader interface.**
  It takes `translate.currentLoader` and calls `setDefaultLang`, `providerRegistered`,
  `registerProvider`, `getFullTranslationJSON` and `init` — none of them part of
  `TranslateLoader`. With a plain loader in place every adf-hx component dies with
  `TypeError: this.customLoader.setDefaultLang is not a function`. Do **not** replace
  `AppTranslateLoader` with adf-core's `TranslateLoaderService`: that deletes the
  manifest-`labels` layering, which is a shipped Layer 0 capability. Extend it instead
  and override `getTranslation`. Note the base declares a **private** `http`, so a
  subclass field of that name fails `TS2415`/`TS4114`. adf-core also fetches
  `assets/adf-core/i18n/<lang>.json`, which has to be added to the build's asset globs.
- **`nuxeo-ui` has no `typecheck` target, so the `typecheck` gate does not cover the
  app.** Two real `TS` errors in `app.config.ts`-adjacent app code passed
  `nx affected -t typecheck` and were caught only by `build`. This is the same trap as
  the `test` gate, one layer over.
- **Decisions taken, do not re-open without new information:**
  - **`ng-mocks` stays stubbed, indefinitely.** Upstream will not be changing the shipped
    `/ui` bundle, so `tools/stubs/ng-mocks/` is the resolution rather than a workaround
    awaiting one. It must survive every adf-hx bump; the `bundle` gate goes red if the
    real library returns, and a future release importing a _different_ test helper shows
    up as a new fingerprint rather than as a silent regression.
  - **`angular-oauth2-oidc` and `cropperjs` are kept**, unused, on the basis that they
    cause no issue today — `pdfjs-dist` tree-shakes out entirely, these two do not. Not
    a blocker; revisit only if something breaks or the SCA position changes.
  - **The initial-bundle cost of adf-hx is accepted.** It stopped being a deferrable
    question the moment the ports had to go in the root injector, so the budget was
    raised deliberately: `maximumWarning` 1.5 → 2.5 MB, `maximumError` 2.0 → 3.5 MB.
    **Leadership has not been told yet and should be** — the numbers for that
    conversation:

    |                     | Initial bundle                          |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
    | before adf-hx       | 1.70 MB                                 |
    | with adf-hx adopted | **3.00 MB**                             |
    | increase            | **+1.30 MB, once, then browser-cached** |

    It is unavoidable rather than a choice. Eleven upstream services are
    `providedIn: 'root'` and resolve the API-port tokens from the root injector, so the
    ports cannot be scoped to the lazily-loaded POC route — providing them on the
    component means shadowing all eleven locally, and that list grows with every
    component adopted. Loading adf-core on demand was tried and fails one `NG0201` at a
    time.

    Practical effect: unnoticeable on an office network, roughly a second or two on the
    first page load over a slow link. The alternatives, if the figure is ever refused,
    are trimming existing weight out of the startup bundle (real work, uncertain payoff)
    or not adopting adf-hx at all, which abandons the premise of the Beta.
- **~~THE CURRENT PHASE 3 BLOCKER~~ RESOLVED — kept because the measurements are the fact.**
  A bundle-boundary problem, not a port problem, closed by the secondary entry point
  `@agentic-ui/shared/adf-hx-bridge/providers`.
  `apps/nuxeo-ui/src/app/shell/app-shell.component.ts` and `nav-drawer.component.ts`
  both import `@agentic-ui/shared/adf-hx-bridge`, whose single barrel re-exports
  `provide-adf-hx-nuxeo-bridge.ts`. The moment that file imports anything from
  `@alfresco/adf-hx-content-services`, adf-hx and its dependencies become reachable from
  the shell and land in the **initial** bundle. Measured: initial goes 1.70 MB → 2.65 MB
  with the ports rebound and the POC untouched, and → 2.86 MB with the swap, against a
  2.00 MB `maximumError`. Removing the ports from the barrel's exports does not help —
  the providers file still imports them. **Rebinding to upstream tokens at all requires
  a secondary entry point in the bridge library, or the shell must stop importing the
  bridge barrel.** The entry point was built and the initial bundle returned to 1.71 MB with
  the ports bound; it is now 3.24 MB for a different and accepted reason — see the
  root-injector fact above. **Nothing eagerly loaded may import from `providers.ts`.**
- **The non-overwriting installer path targets `nxserver/nuxeo.war/agentic-ui-config`.**
  A second `install.xml` copy step with `overwrite="false"` puts customer
  configuration in a _sibling_ of the bundle, outside the destructive copy's
  source tree, so it survives an upgrade. **The destination must be under
  `nxserver/nuxeo.war`** — that is the Tomcat docBase for the `/nuxeo` context
  (`docBase="../nxserver/nuxeo.war"`). `nxserver/web` holds only `root.war`, is
  not a docBase, and anything installed there is never served. Phase 1 shipped the
  `nxserver/web/…` variant and it would have 404'd in every deployment; the
  corrected path is verified served on the local container. **Risk R7 is still
  Medium:** no package has been built, installed and upgraded on a real server.
  That is the Phase 6 upgrade rehearsal.
- **Configuration is loaded, not compiled.** `libs/shared/app-config` reads a
  static bootstrap file pre-auth and a runtime manifest from the Nuxeo document
  at `/default-domain/config/agentic-ui` post-auth. Eleven `InjectionToken`
  factories resolve from it. Both loads are tolerant: a missing file, absent
  document, 403 or malformed JSON falls back to the packaged defaults, and the
  packaged defaults reproduce the pre-Phase-1 compiled values exactly.
- **Angular's hash routing hides configuration reloads from evidence captures.**
  `withHashLocation()` makes route changes same-document, so `page.goto('/#/x')`
  does not re-run `APP_INITIALIZER`. Any capture that changes configuration must
  force a full reload, and route interception must send `Cache-Control: no-store`
  or the browser answers from cache and the interception is never seen.
- **Angular's build configurations REPLACE `assets`; they do not merge it.** Only
  `architect.build.options.assets` carried adf-core's translation glob, so **every dev server
  ever started on this branch 404ed `/assets/adf-core/i18n/en.json`** while the production
  build shipped it correctly. This was diagnosed for a full session as a stale dev server
  needing a restart, which could never have helped. A `guardrails` check now fails when any
  configuration overrides `assets` and omits a base entry. **If a dev server 404s an asset the
  production build ships, check the `development` array before anything else.**
- **adf-hx's own i18n catalogues will not load themselves.** adf-hx components _do_ register
  them — `provideTranslations('adf-enterprise-adf-hx-content-services-ui', …)` sits in each
  component's own `providers` — but registration happens at **component construction**, long
  after the language has loaded, and `AppTranslateLoader.init` is a no-op by design. So the
  registration lands and the strings never arrive: the versions panel rendered
  `MANAGE_VERSIONS.DIALOG.TITLE` as its heading. Both adf-hx catalogues are now **seeded**
  alongside adf-core's in `SEEDED_FOLDERS`, and the `bundle` gate asserts all three ship.
  **Adopting a new adf-hx component means checking its keys resolve, not just that it renders.**
- **`AsyncPipe` must be provided for any adf-hx component that renders a user.**
  `UserResolverPipe` calls `inject(AsyncPipe)` in its constructor and `AsyncPipe` carries no
  `providedIn`. Missing, it throws `NG0201` **while rendering** — the component's shell appears
  and its content does not, which reads as an empty panel rather than an injector error. It is
  in `ADF_HX_NUXEO_BRIDGE_PROVIDERS`.
- **Upstream renders every user as `` `${firstName} ${lastName}` `` with no guard.**
  `UserResolverService.getFullName` is exactly that. Nuxeo's own `Administrator` has both
  properties set to the **empty string**, and a `User` built from a bare username has both
  **unset** — which rendered the literal `undefined undefined`. Both mappers now put the
  username in `firstName` and leave `lastName` empty. **Never hand upstream a `User` with an
  unset `firstName`.**
- **`UserService.resolveUser` caches per id.** Given a username _string_, upstream resolves it
  through the `USER` port once and caches the observable for the app's lifetime. That makes a
  display-name lookup far cheaper than the earlier assessment of "a `/user/{id}` call per
  distinct contributor on every page" implied, and it is the live path in the versions panel.
- **Nuxeo sends no `versionLabel`.** Its REST payload carries `uid:major_version` and
  `uid:minor_version` as separate integers and no composed label, so `sysver_title` must be
  built. And **a version's `parentRef` is the live document's _folder_, not the live document** —
  the live document id is `versionableId`, which is what `sys_parentId` must carry, because
  `DocumentVersionsService.getCurrentDocument` follows it.
- **`/search/lang/NXQL/execute` is OpenSearch-backed here and lags.** Measured: immediately
  after two `Document.CheckIn` calls the NXQL query for a document's versions returned **one**
  of the two, and both only once the index caught up. `Document.GetVersions` reads the
  repository directly and returned both immediately. **Anything that must reflect a write it
  just made cannot go through the search endpoint.**
- **`Document.GetVersions` answers oldest-first**, and adf-hx's HXQL asks for
  `ORDER BY sysver_created DESC`. The ordering is applied in the `QUERY` port; a port that
  returned Nuxeo's order would look correct on any single-version document.
- **`@versions` is not a registered adapter on this Nuxeo distribution.**
  `GET /id/{uid}/@versions` answers `404 Service versions not found for object`. Use the
  `Document.GetVersions` operation instead.
- **The Nuxeo content model needs THREE reads, and `/config/types` alone is a trap.**
  `/config/types` gives doctypes (`parent`, `facets`, `schemas`) and a **flat** schema map
  covering only the schemas a doctype reaches — 48 of 98 on the local instance. `/config/facets`
  is the only way to learn what a facet contributes, because a doctype lists its facets by name.
  `/config/schemas` is the nested superset. Reading schemas from `/config/types` silently omits
  fifty of them.
- **adf-hx's `FieldType` values ARE Nuxeo's field type strings** —
  `boolean | blob | complex | date | double | long | object | string`, each with a `[]` variant.
  And `DocumentModel.resolveType` returns any type it does not recognise unchanged. So
  `Model.types` is left **empty** on purpose: there is nothing in Nuxeo to populate it from, and
  populating it could only _change_ types that are already right.
- **HxPR keys a schema's fields by their PREFIXED name; sub-fields stay unprefixed.**
  `{ prefix: 'dc', fields: { dc_title: … } }`. `getSchemaByPrefix('dc_title')` splits on `_`,
  takes `dc`, then requires `Object.keys(fields)` to contain the **whole** `dc_title`. Keyed by
  the bare `title` it matches nothing and **every field silently becomes `FieldType.String`** —
  dates rendering as raw ISO strings, which looks like a formatting bug. But
  `getComplexFieldDetails` and the dotted-path branch of `getFieldDefinition` look sub-fields up
  by their **bare** name, so prefixing those breaks what prefixing the top level fixes.
- **A Nuxeo `@prefix` of `''` means "use the schema name", not "no prefix".** `file`, `uid` and
  `files` all report empty, and Nuxeo then addresses them as `file:content` and
  `uid:major_version`. Read literally the keys become `_content` and `_major_version`.
- **`sys_primaryType` is the key into `Model.primaryTypes`, so it must carry the NUXEO doctype
  name.** It was a synthetic `SysFolder`/`SysFile` for most of Phase 3, and that broke four things
  for one reason: the `MODEL` port keys the registry by Nuxeo doctype, because that is the only
  registry Nuxeo has. Visible — the properties panel's **Category select rendered empty**. Latent —
  `extractCustomSchemaFields(sys_primaryType)` finds no custom schema fields; `getSubtypes` falls
  back to all sixty types; and the document-category search filter emits
  `sys_primaryType IN ('…')` as HXQL against a type name Nuxeo has never heard of.
  **`isRoot()` is the only place upstream compares this to a `Sys*` literal**, so `SysRoot`
  survives for the synthetic repository root and nothing else needs a synthetic value.
  **Do not classify with `sys_primaryType`** — folderishness is `sys_isFolderish` and
  `sys_mixinTypes`.
- **The folder header renders `sys_typeLabel ?? sys_primaryType`.** With the synthetic root
  unlabelled the POC's landing screen read "Repository / **SysRoot**". Any `Sys*` value that can
  reach a label needs a `sys_typeLabel` beside it.
- **Nuxeo answers an unsupported `sortBy` with HTTP 200 and ZERO entries.** Not an error —
  measured with `sortBy=ecm:isFolder` on `@children`. So a sort key must be validated _before_ the
  request: forwarding one renders an empty folder, which reads as missing data. `NuxeoQueryApi`
  refuses by name and lists the sortable keys.
- **"Folders first" cannot be expressed as a Nuxeo sort.** There is no sortable folderish property,
  so `sys_isFolderish` has no mapping and the default order dropped it. Nothing regressed: the sort
  was being **discarded entirely** by the port, so folders-first was never actually applied.
- **Nuxeo counts only within `resultsCountLimit`, which it sets to the requested `pageSize`.** So
  `resultsCount` is a real total **exactly when the result set fits on one page**, and `-2`
  otherwise — measured, `pageSize=39` over 39 children answered `39` while `pageSize=20` answered
  `-2`. **The total is known only when there is nothing to page**, which is why a numbered pager is
  impossible and `isNextPageAvailable` is the fact to build on.
- **adf-core's DataTable sorts the loaded page client-side, independently of any server sort.** So a
  reordered list does **not** prove the server was asked to order — that is what made the dropped
  sort look fixed for several phases. Assert on the request, not on the row order.
- **The eager bundle has TWO causes.** `CONTEXT_MENU_ACTIONS_PROVIDERS` in `app.config.ts`, **and**
  the app shell's nav drawer rendering upstream's `HxpDocumentTreeComponent`. The second is a product
  decision, so adf-hx is eagerly needed by the shell by design. It is the one documented exception in
  the API-surface gate.
- **Nuxeo has no `sys` schema, so the bridge supplies one.** Upstream's
  `DocumentPropertiesService` lists properties from `Object.keys(document)` and its
  `TOP_DEFAULT_PROPERTIES` are all `sys_*`, so a faithfully translated Nuxeo model types **none**
  of them: `Created` rendered `2026-08-22T14:23:05.687Z` and `Creator` rendered
  **`[object Object]`**. The `MODEL` mapper now adds a `sys` pseudo-schema describing the fields
  _our own document mapper emits_ — declaring our output, not guessing at Nuxeo's. **If the two
  drift apart the panel mistypes a field**, which is why one spec asserts the pair together.
- **A document carries TWO property surfaces, and upstream's design is what stops them
  duplicating.** `sys_*` fills the properties panel's _main_ section; Nuxeo's own properties as
  `prefix_field` fill the _other_ section, because upstream excludes `sys_`, `sysfile_blob`,
  `sysver_` and `sysgov_` from it. Do not "clean this up" by removing one.
- **`SysFilish` on a type must come from the `file` schema, not from "is not `Folderish`".**
  `hasMixin` walks `extends`; `Folder extends Document`; `Document` is not `Folderish`. The
  fallback marked `Document` filish and **every folder inherited it**.
- **Look for an exported provider array before chasing `NG0201` one at a time.** `AsyncPipe`,
  `UserResolverPipe`, `DOCUMENT_PROPERTIES_SERVICE` and `DOCUMENT_SERVICE` were each added in
  response to a separate injector error before `DOCUMENT_PROVIDERS` and `USER_RESOLVER_PROVIDERS`
  turned up, already exported, in `provideAdfEnterpriseAdfHxContentServicesServices()`. Note the
  gap that function still leaves: it provides adf-hx's pipes and **not adf-core's**, so
  `PropertyUtilService` cannot construct without `DecimalNumberPipe`, `LocalizedDatePipe` and
  `FileSizePipe` as well.
- **adf-core renders property values inside `<input>` elements, so `innerText` does not contain
  them.** Two evidence assertions passed while the screenshot showed a raw ISO timestamp and
  `[object Object]`. **A negative assertion over text that cannot contain the value is not an
  assertion** — read `input.value` too.
- **~~Nuxeo has no `sys` schema, and that is the metadata-sidebar problem.~~ Resolved above.** Upstream's
  `DocumentPropertiesService` lists properties from `Object.keys(document)`; our mapper emits
  `sys_*`. A faithfully translated Nuxeo model therefore types **none** of them. Making the
  metadata sidebar work is a decision about the document's property surface, not a mapping fix.
- **adf-hx writes `SysFilish`, with no `e`** — in `isFile()`, `getFilishTypes()` and two mixin
  checks. Our mapper emitted `SysFileish`, so `isFile()` was always false for every non-folder
  document we produce.
- **`adf-hx-bridge` can be unit-tested against real upstream services, but only with two vitest
  settings.** adf-core's fesm bundle does a _directory_ import of `date-fns/locale`, which Node's
  ESM resolver rejects; Vitest externalises `node_modules`, so `resolve.alias` never sees the
  specifier. An alias **plus** `server.deps.inline` for `@alfresco/*` and `date-fns` is what
  makes it work. The Angular bundler tolerates the directory import, which is why the
  application builds and only tests were affected. Worth the setup: the field-key discovery above
  came from a `DocumentModelService` integration test, not from reading the bundle.
- **`DocumentModelService` calls `modelApi.getModel()` eagerly from its constructor — but a
  refusing port does NOT stop it constructing.** It is `providedIn: 'root'` and injects
  `MODEL_API_TOKEN`. The eager call is real; the obvious conclusion from it is wrong. Our
  refusing `getModel` is `async`, so its `throw` becomes a **rejected promise**, and
  `from(promise)` does not touch it until something subscribes. Verified in
  `nuxeo-unmapped-api.spec.ts` — which exists because the opposite was asserted in three files
  first, on reasoning alone. Two real consequences:
  - an **unhandled promise rejection reaches the console at injection time**, before any user
    action, because the constructor makes a rejected promise nobody is subscribed to. It will
    trip `expectNoConsoleErrors` the moment metadata-sidebar or properties-viewer is adopted,
    and only a read-side `MODEL` removes it;
  - the failure lands **where the model is read**, so the component renders and its property
    fields fail — which is the behaviour a refusing port is _meant_ to have, and why these two
    ports are bound rather than left unbound.
    **This is the general shape of every refusing port: bound, constructs, fails at the point of
    use. Do not describe one as a construction-time blocker without testing it.**

## 4. Phases and their gates

Each phase is complete only when **all three** of its gates pass. Partial
completion is not completion; see section 6.

| Phase              | Deliverable                                                                      | Evidence steps file          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `phase-0-baseline` | Dependencies install, gates run, CI validates the branch                         | `steps/phase-0-baseline.mjs` |
| `phase-1-config`   | Runtime configuration that survives upgrade, runtime theming, i18n for the slice | `steps/phase-1-config.mjs`   |
| `phase-2-registry` | Extension registry, rules, nav and routes from manifest, action registry         | `steps/phase-2-registry.mjs` |
| `phase-3-adf-hx`   | ~10 of 12 Nuxeo-backed API ports, component swap, encapsulation gate             | to be added                  |
| `phase-4-platform` | Publishable libraries, public API, semver, template and starter                  | to be added                  |
| `phase-5-harness`  | Customer knowledge base, generators, runnable guardrails                         | to be added                  |
| `phase-6-quality`  | Coverage, E2E, accessibility, security scans, upgrade rehearsal                  | to be added                  |

### The gates

1. **Quality gate** — `npm run beta:gate -- --phase <id>` is green with
   `verdict: "pass"`, **not** `pass-partial` (node, lockfile, guardrails,
   assertions, affected lint, test, build, typecheck).
2. **Evidence gate** — `npm run beta:evidence -- <id>` exits 0, meaning every
   step recorded at least one check and every check passed. Exit 2 is
   `precondition-not-met`: fix the environment, do not iterate.
3. **Independent validation** — the evidence auditor and acceptance validator in
   `AGENTS/12-review-agents.md` have both run, neither on its own author's work.
   `npm run beta:audit` and `npm run beta:state` are their mechanical half.
4. **Review gate** — the phase's `INDEX.md` is attached to the PR, and a
   multi-model adversarial review has run over the diff.

Gate 3 is new because gates 1, 2 and 4 all passed on Phase 1 while its config path
would have 404'd on every install. It is the only gate that has ever caught that
class of defect here, and it has **never been run** for Phase 1 or Phase 2.

## 5. Agent roster

Cursor's subagent types are fixed, so this roster is a convention the skills
apply rather than a config file. Use the `Task` tool with the stated type and
model.

| Role           | Subagent type         | Model                                     | Used for                                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Architect      | `generalPurpose`      | Claude Opus 5 thinking / GPT-5.6          | Public API design, action registry shape, extension contract decisions |
| Implementer    | inherit (main thread) | Claude Sonnet 5 thinking                  | API ports, component swaps, feature work                               |
| Explorer       | `explore`             | inherit                                   | Locating code, mapping call sites before a change                      |
| Test author    | `generalPurpose`      | Composer 2.5 Fast / Gemini 3.7 Flash      | Spec scaffolding, i18n extraction, codemods                            |
| Reviewer panel | `generalPurpose` x2-3 | Opus 5 **and** GPT-5.6 **and** Gemini 3.7 | Adversarial review; different families surface different defects       |
| Bug hunter     | `bugbot`              | inherit                                   | Pre-PR review of branch changes                                        |
| Security       | `security-review`     | inherit                                   | Any change touching auth, blobs or config loading                      |

**Rule on reviews:** never accept a single model's verdict on its own output.
Agreement across two families is the signal; disagreement means a human looks.

---

## 6. Iteration protocol

Agents consistently declare victory early. This protocol exists to prevent that.

1. Make the smallest change that could satisfy the step.
2. Run the **fast inner loop**: `npm run beta:gate -- --gates guardrails,lint`.
3. Fix the single first reported failure. Do not batch speculative fixes.
4. Repeat 2-3 until green, then run the **full gate**.
5. Run the evidence capture for the phase.
6. If either gate fails, return to step 3. **Maximum three attempts per step**;
   after the third, stop and report what is blocking rather than continuing to
   churn.
7. Only when both gates pass may the step be marked complete.

Stop conditions that require a human, not another attempt:

- The same failure recurs after three distinct fix attempts.
- A fix requires changing a verified fact in section 3.
- A fix requires widening the public API or touching `install.xml` packaging.
- A test would have to be weakened or skipped to pass.

**Never** mark a step complete on the basis of reasoning alone. The gate output
and the evidence manifest are the only acceptable proof.

---

## 7. Non-negotiables for Beta code

Beyond the standing rules in `AGENTS.md`:

- **adf-hx types never appear in our public API signatures.** Wrap them in
  `libs/shared/adf-hx-bridge`. Their instability must not become the customer's.
- **Pin exact adf-hx versions**, never a range or dist-tag.
- **Anything a customer might want to change goes through Layer 0 or 1.** No new
  hardcoded action lists, nav entries, or theme values.
- **No configuration inside the packaged web directory.** It will be destroyed on
  upgrade.
- **Every new service method gets a unit test including its error path.** The
  bridge currently has 11 tests for 2,949 lines; do not add to that debt.
- **Credentials from the environment only**, per `AGENTS/07-security.md`.
