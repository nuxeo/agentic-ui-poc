## 4-Layer Model

```
apps/nuxeo-ui                    ← App Shell (routing, auth, global search, header)
    ↓ lazy-loads
libs/features/*                  ← Feature Modules (browse, search, document-detail, …)
    ↓ imports from               ← NEVER import from sibling features
libs/shared/*                    ← Shared Libraries (services, UI components, models)
    ↓ HTTP calls via
Nuxeo Server                     ← via Angular dev proxy (:8080) in dev; same-origin in prod
```

### Critical Boundary Rules (enforced by Nx lint)

1. **Features NEVER import from other features.** `libs/features/browse` cannot import from `libs/features/search`. Shared state goes in `libs/shared/`.
2. **Services ALWAYS live in `libs/shared/nuxeo-client/src/lib/services/`**. Feature components never own services.
3. **Components NEVER inject `NuxeoApiBase` directly.** They inject domain services (e.g. `DocumentDetailService`).
4. **Every component is `standalone: true`.** No NgModules exist anywhere.
5. **Every template is external.** Use `templateUrl`, never inline `template`.

## `nxs-` component library (NXSAT-308)

`libs/shared/satori-components` holds the Nuxeo-owned components that replace the adf-hx ones.
It is published as `@nuxeo-satori/platform/components` — `@nuxeo/satori-platform/components`
after the scope rename sweep. Selector prefix `nxs-`, class prefix `Nxs`.

**Tags: `scope:shared` and `type:ui`**, the same pair as `libs/shared/ui`. `scope:shared` because
features, the app and `libs/platform` (`type:publishable`, which may depend on `scope:shared`) all
consume it and it must never depend on a feature; `type:ui` because that is what the app's rule
admits. No new `depConstraints` entry was needed. Tags cannot say "no ADF, no Satori" — those are
npm packages, not projects — so that is what the guardrails below are for.

**Rules.** Each is a guardrail in `scripts/review-guardrails.mjs`, run by the `guardrails` gate and
by CI, with negative controls in `scripts/review-guardrails.selftest.mjs` (the `guardrails-selftest`
gate, also in CI):

| Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Guardrail                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| No `@alfresco/*` and no `@hylandsoftware/*` — imported directly, reached through any workspace import, or `@use`d in a stylesheet. A type-only import counts                                                             | `checkSatoriComponentsDependencies`        |
| Reached only through `@nuxeo-satori/platform/components`: no subpath under it, no relative path into the library, no second alias, and the alias and `libs/platform/components/ng-package.json` both name `src/index.ts` | `checkSatoriComponentsEntryPoint`          |
| Federation readiness: no `@NgModule`, every component, directive and pipe says `standalone: true`, and no `providedIn` of any value                                                                                      | `checkSatoriComponentsFederationReadiness` |
| Every component the barrel exports has a `*.stories.ts` under `src/` whose meta says `component: <Class>` and exports a story, and `.storybook/main.ts` loads `../src/**/*.stories.ts`                                   | `checkSatoriComponentsHaveStories`         |

Satori is to reach these components only through a later, separate `/components-satori` entry
point that re-registers the same IDs, so that once Satori is an optional peer of the package (the
plan's `satori-fallback` work), a customer without GitHub Packages access still gets the Material
implementations.

**Storybook 9** (`@nx/storybook`, `@storybook/angular`) documents the library, one story per
exported component:

```bash
npx nx run satori-components:storybook              # dev server on :6006
npx nx run satori-components:build-storybook        # static build, dist/storybook/satori-components
npx nx run satori-components:build-storybook:satori # the same under Satori's theme; needs the token
```

The default build needs **no GitHub Packages token**: it themes with plain `mat.theme`
(`.storybook/material-theme.scss`), and `checkSatoriComponentsDependencies` covers `.storybook/*.ts`
and the default configuration's `styles` as well as `src/`. Whenever the library is affected, CI
builds it with `@hylandsoftware` and `@alfresco` removed from `node_modules`, so an accidental
Satori import fails the build rather than compiling. Only the opt-in `:satori` configuration reaches `@hylandsoftware/satori-ui`, for its theme.
`typecheck` type-checks the stories too. Where the static build is hosted is not decided.

**Coverage: a hard 90% line floor** (`FLOORS` in `scripts/beta-harness/coverage-gate.mjs`), from
the first commit rather than ratcheted. The floor also fails when the library was not measured,
and when any of its files sits outside the measurement — only `noStatements` barrels are excused,
never a dated allowlist entry. `npm run beta:coverage` runs at the end of the SonarCloud workflow,
after its test-with-coverage step.

**`@nuxeo-satori/platform/nuxeo-client` and `@nuxeo-satori/platform/extensions` are importable**,
because the dependency rule follows imports and neither barrel now reaches a banned package.
Both once did: `nuxeo-client`'s `avatar-colors.ts` imported a Satori type, and `extensions` imported
`@alfresco/adf-extensions`. Controls in `scripts/review-guardrails.selftest.mjs` run the rule over
the real `libs/` tree and put each import back, so a regression in either barrel is red there.

If another library is refused, fix the file that carries the package, rather than copying code
into the library to dodge the rule.

**Adding a component, with every gate staying green:**

1. `src/lib/<name>/<name>.component.{ts,html,scss,spec.ts}` — selector `nxs-<name>`, class
   `Nxs<Name>Component`, `standalone: true`, `templateUrl`, theme tokens only.
2. Text inputs take already-translated strings; the library ships no catalogue.
   `checkNoProseInComponentInputs` scans `nxs-` elements, so a caller must bind them.
3. The spec covers the empty and error paths and keeps the library at 90% or more:
   `npx nx test satori-components --coverage.enabled=true`, then `npm run beta:coverage`.
4. Export it from `src/index.ts`, run `npm run beta:api -- --update` and review the
   `docs/api/platform.api.md` diff, then `npm run beta:publishable`.
5. `src/lib/<name>/<name>.stories.ts` with `component: Nxs<Name>Component` in its meta and a story
   per meaningful state; `checkSatoriComponentsHaveStories` fails an exported component without one.
   Stories and `.storybook/` are outside the coverage floor and SonarCloud, like specs.
6. A new runtime dependency is a `libs/platform/package.json` peer, or is listed in
   `allowedNonPeerDependencies`.
7. Shared state is an `InjectionToken` with an exported `provide…()` function, never `providedIn`.

## adf-hx Browse POC

Parallel browse at `/#/browse-adf-hx?path=…` using `@agentic-ui/shared/adf-hx-bridge`. Does **not** replace production `/#/browse`. Feature page: `libs/features/browse/src/lib/browse-adf-hx-poc/`.

→ Full detail: `libs/shared/adf-hx-bridge/ARCHITECTURE.md` · Agent rule: `.cursor/rules/adf-hx-browse-poc.mdc`

---

## Routing

All routes use `HashLocationStrategy` (`/#/path`). This ensures Nuxeo/Tomcat serves `index.html` for all deep links without 404s.

| Path                | Component                    | Auth       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| `/#/login`          | LoginPageComponent           | Public     |
| `/#/dashboard`      | DashboardPageComponent       | Required   |
| `/#/browse`         | BrowseComponent              | Required   |
| `/#/browse-adf-hx`  | BrowseAdfHxPocComponent      | Required   |
| `/#/search`         | SearchComponent              | Required   |
| `/#/doc/:uid`       | DocumentDetailComponent      | Required   |
| `/#/documents`      | AssetSearchResultsComponent  | Required   |
| `/#/tasks`          | TasksPageComponent           | Required   |
| `/#/collections`    | CollectionDetailComponent    | Required   |
| `/#/trash`          | TrashComponent               | Required   |
| `/#/administration` | AdministrationShellComponent | Admin only |

---

## Authentication Flow

**Development (`:4200`):**

- `NuxeoAuthInterceptor` adds `Authorization: Basic <base64>` to all `/nuxeo/*` requests
- Credentials from `environment.ts`

**Production (same-origin with Nuxeo):**

- SAML SSO via `NuxeoSSOProviders`
- Session cookie handles authentication

**Auth Guards:**

- `authGuard` — redirects to `/login` if not authenticated
- `loginGuard` — redirects to `/dashboard` if already authenticated
- `adminGuard` — 403 if user is not in `administrators` group

---

## Configuration delivery (server side)

Configuration is contributed by Marketplace packages, never edited on the server (NXSAT-312).
`nuxeo-agentic-core` declares the component `org.nuxeo.agentic.ui.config` with the extension point
`configuration` (`<fragment layer="bootstrap|manifest">`, `<layout type mode>`, `<asset>`) and
contributes our defaults to it. `AgenticUiConfigServlet` serves the ordered fragments, with
provenance, at `/nuxeo/agentic-ui-config/` — **anonymously**, so nothing sensitive may be
contributed. A customer ships their own package that depends on `nuxeo-agentic-ui` and
`<require>`s `org.nuxeo.agentic.ui.config.defaults`. Detail:
`documentation/30-engineering/13-deployment-and-troubleshooting.md` §2.

---

## Key Conventions

- Dependency injection: `inject()` function, never constructor parameters
- State: `signal()` for all mutable state, `computed()` for derived values, `effect()` for side effects
- Subscriptions: always use `takeUntilDestroyed()` — never manual `unsubscribe()`
- Blob URLs: always `URL.revokeObjectURL()` in `ngOnDestroy` for every `createObjectURL`
- Authenticated content: always use `HttpClient` (via services) — never `<img [src]="nuxeoUrl">`
- Imports: `@nuxeo-satori/platform/nuxeo-client`, `@nuxeo-satori/platform/ui`, `@nuxeo-satori/platform/components`, `@agentic-ui/shared/ai-client`, `@agentic-ui/shared/kd-client`, `@agentic-ui/shared/ke-client`
