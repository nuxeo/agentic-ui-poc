/**
 * The regression guard for NXQL injection through the search term.
 *
 * ## Why `/#/search`
 *
 * These two cases used to drive `/#/search-adf-hx`, which interpolated the term into a
 * `sys_fulltext = '<term>*'` literal through `escapeHxqlLiteral` — the path the original
 * adversarial review found the injection in. NXSAT-308 deletes that route with the rest of
 * adf-hx, so the coverage moves to the search page that stays, before the route goes.
 *
 * `/#/search` writes no query text at all. `SearchService.search` sends the drawer's term to the
 * `default_search` page provider as the `ecm_fulltext` named parameter, and Nuxeo binds it into
 * the predicate server-side. There is no client-side escape to assert, so these assert the
 * property any implementation has to keep — **the term reaches Nuxeo as data, never as query
 * structure** — on whichever endpoint carries it:
 *
 *   - page provider: the bound `ecm_fulltext` value is the term verbatim, and no other parameter
 *     carries it. A client that pre-escapes, strips or rewrites the term fails here;
 *   - NXQL: the term sits inside an escaped literal, and stripping every literal leaves none of
 *     it behind. This branch is for a rewrite of the search page that builds NXQL itself, which
 *     the `nxs-` rebuild of search results could; it does not run against today's page.
 *
 * ## What is load-bearing
 *
 * The wire, not the page: as above, `/search` never renders its error signal, so a DOM "no error"
 * check would be vacuous, and there is none. The status Nuxeo answered and the `resultsCount` it
 * returned are what can fail. Measured on the shared instance on 2026-10-08: the payload below as
 * the bound value returns 0 documents; the same payload concatenated into an NXQL literal returns
 * 1,940 — every document — and an unescaped apostrophe in NXQL answers HTTP 400.
