/**
 * Cross-engine behaviour — Phase 6 step 5, "Chrome and Safari verified".
 *
 * ## Why this file exists separately from the other twelve specs
 *
 * Registering the `webkit` project made all twelve existing specs pass on the first attempt.
 * That is a weak result presented as a strong one: those specs assert that surfaces render and
 * that repository data arrives, and **nothing about them is engine-sensitive**. A suite that
 * passes identically on two engines has not compared them — it has run the same
 * engine-independent assertions twice.
 *
 * Engines actually diverge in a small number of places, and this file targets the ones this
 * application depends on. Each test below is here because a *specific* known difference could
 * break it, and that reason is stated on the test. They run under both projects, so a
 * divergence shows up as one engine red and the other green rather than as a vague failure.
 *
 * ## The claim this file supports, and the one it does not
 *
 * It supports: "the Beta surfaces behave the same on Blink and WebKit for date rendering, blob
 * decoding, session persistence across reload, and keyboard reachability".
 *
 * It does **not** support "verified on Safari". WebKit-via-Playwright shares Safari's engine but
 * not its UI, its extension surface, or iOS's stricter storage partitioning and autoplay rules.
 * Nothing here runs on a real Safari or on iOS. That gap is recorded rather than blurred,
 * because "Chrome and Safari verified" is a checklist line a customer may read literally.

   * The classic Safari divergence: `new Date('2026-08-24 10:00:00')` — a space instead of `T` —

   * (`dc:modified` was verified as `"2026-06-03T04:25:33.196Z"` on the local instance), so this
   * should hold; the point is that nothing was asserting it, and a future field fed from a
   * differently-formatted source would break on Safari only.

   * Asserted as the *absence* of the failure strings, because that is what a user sees. A date
