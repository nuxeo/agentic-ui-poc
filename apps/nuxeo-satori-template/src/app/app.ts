/**
 * The template shell.
 *
 * The navigation is **resolved from the extension registry**, not written here.
 * That is the single most important line in the template: it is what makes the
 * nav addressable, so a manifest can hide, reorder, relabel or add an entry with
 * no change to this component.
 *
 * It calls `AppExtensionsService.resolve()` directly rather than injecting
 * `APP_NAV_ITEMS`. That token's factory registers the *product's* fifteen nav
 * entries as a side effect of being injected, which would point a fork at fifteen
 * routes it does not have.
 *
 * The brand comes from Layer 0. It used to be the literal string "Nuxeo Satori"
 * in the template, which quietly weakened the whole rebrand claim: `bootstrap.json`
 * carried `branding.applicationTitle`, the browser tab honoured it, and the one
 * place a viewer actually looks did not.
