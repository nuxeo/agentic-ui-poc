/**
 * Everything this template contributes in **code** — Layer 2.
 *
 * This file is the one a fork edits first, and it exercises all five kinds of
 * contribution deliberately, so that a customer copying it has a worked example
 * of each rather than a shape they have to infer:
 *
 * | Contribution      | Demonstrated by                                              |
 * | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
 * | `slots`           | two navbar entries, one of them rule-gated                    |
 * | `rules`           | `template.rules.isSignedIn`, closing over a service           |
 * | `failClosedRules` | the same rule, so an unregistered build denies rather than permits |
 * | `components`      | a lazily-loaded panel addressable by id from the manifest      |
 * | `actions`         | a handler the manifest can place in any slot                   |
 *
 * The **factory form** is used rather than a plain object because the rule needs
 * `inject()`. That is not a contrived example: two of the product's own rules
 * close over `AuthService` and all six of its bulk handlers close over an
 * `Injector`, so a real customer hits this on the first non-trivial rule.

/**
 * Declared as a typed `const` rather than inline in `slots`, and that is load
 * bearing rather than stylistic.
 *
 * `SatoriExtensionContributions.slots` is typed `Record<ExtensionSlotId, readonly
 * ExtensionElement[]>`, and `ExtensionElement` carries only `id`, `disabled` and
 * `order` — the fields the registry itself honours for every slot. Writing these
 * objects inline makes them *fresh literals*, so TypeScript applies excess
 * property checking and rejects `label`, `path` and `icon` with TS2418.
 *
 * Assigning an already-typed `readonly NavItemDescriptor[]` is fine, because
 * `NavItemDescriptor extends ExtensionElement` and the check does not apply to a
 * non-fresh value. So: give every slot's descriptors their real type, then
 * reference them. That is also how a customer discovers which fields a slot
 * expects, instead of guessing.
