/**
 * The accessible name of the Clipboard navigation item.
 *
 * It used to be built by interpolation — `` `${navText(item)}, ${count} ${noun}` `` with `noun`
 * chosen in TypeScript. That is an INFO-144 violation, and worse than merely untranslated: a
 * string assembled at runtime has no catalogue entry, so no locale could ever have reached it.
 *
 * **Nothing exercised this path.** The keys were added, the catalogue and `en-fallback.ts` were
 * updated, and no test read the result — so the concatenation could have come back unnoticed.
 * That gap is why this file exists.
 *
 * ## Why the catalogue is supplied here rather than loaded
 *
 * `appConfig.providers` wires the real `AppTranslateLoader`, which **fetches** the catalogue, and
 * `provideHttpClientTesting()` serves nothing — so under this harness every key passes straight
 * through and an assertion on visible text reads `nav.clipboard.aria-label-one`.
 *
 * Supplying the strings with `setTranslation` makes the test deterministic and, more importantly,
 * lets it use **distinct singular and plural text with markers**. Asserting the real English
 * (`Clipboard, 1 item`) would be weaker: the interpolated version this replaced produces the same
 * bytes, so an English assertion cannot tell the two apart. That is the same trap as the `en-US`
 * date assertions elsewhere in this repository, which agreed with the hardcoded implementation on
 * every machine.
 *
 * Catalogue *presence* of these keys is covered elsewhere: `en-fallback.ts` carries both, and the
 * `guardrails` gate fails any key with no `en.context.json` entry.
