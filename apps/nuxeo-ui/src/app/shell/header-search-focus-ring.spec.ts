/**
 * NXENG-775 — the header global-search input must show a keyboard focus indicator.
 *
 * `.header-search-input` declared `outline: none` with no replacement anywhere, and
 * `apps/nuxeo-ui/src/styles.scss` has no global `:focus-visible` fallback. The input is the
 * first Tab stop on every page in the app, and focusing it changed zero of the 19312 pixels
 * in its box — WCAG 2.1 SC 2.4.7, and failure technique F78.
 *
 * These tests run in real Chrome (`ng test nuxeo-ui` is the Karma builder, and its `styles`
 * option loads the app's global stylesheet), so they assert the *rendered* cascade rather
 * than the text of a stylesheet: the host below pulls in the real
 * `app-shell.component.scss`, focus is moved for real, and the ring is read back out of
 * `getComputedStyle` and measured. A test that grepped the SCSS could not tell a rule that
 * applies from one that is overridden.
 *
 * Three regressions are pinned deliberately, each of which was live at some point while the
 * fix was being written:
 *
 *  1. The ring must be on the input, not on `.header-search-input-wrap`. The wrapper is not
 *     focusable, and a ring on it is invisible to any tool that inspects the focused
 *     element — which is how this went unnoticed.
 *  2. `.header-search-input:focus` must stay its own selector. IBM Equal Access's
 *     `style_focus_visible` reads only `:focus` (it collects `:focus-visible` and
 *     `:focus-within` and then never reads them) and its lookup does not resolve selector
 *     lists, so `&:focus, &:focus-visible` puts the finding straight back.
 *  3. The ring must resolve in the same colour scheme as the surface behind it. Because
 *     `outline-offset` paints the ring outside the field, the colour it contrasts against is
 *     whatever is behind the header — not the field's pinned white. An earlier version of
 *     this fix pinned the wrapper to `color-scheme: light` to keep the ring dark on that
 *     white; measuring the surface the ring actually touches showed that made it 2.65:1 on a
 *     dark header. Letting it track the theme gives 5.80–10.11:1 across the four packaged
 *     themes and both OS schemes.
 *
 * What these tests do NOT cover: the numeric contrast in each packaged theme. The
 * fixture below is a synthetic DOM with no header behind it, so it can only measure against
 * the surface it does have. The theme × colour-scheme combinations were measured against the
 * running app and recorded in the evidence folder; what is pinned here is the invariant that
 * makes them hold — the ring resolves through the theme token and does not pin its scheme.
