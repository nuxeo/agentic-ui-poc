   * `escapeHtml` runs first, then six regexes build the markup, then DOMPurify enforces
   * {@link AI_MARKDOWN_POLICY}. The DOMPurify pass is new: this pipe previously bypassed straight to
   * `innerHTML` on the strength of the escaping alone.
   *
   * That was safe, but only conditionally, and the condition was invisible. After `escapeHtml` no
   * `<` can originate in the input, and the one interpolated attribute is `value="$1"` where `$1` is
   * `(\d+)` — so nothing attacker-controlled reached an attribute position. The problem is that this
   * held only as long as all six regexes and `escapeHtml` stayed exactly as written, with nothing
   * checking that, while the input is AI-generated text derived from document content. A single
   * future regex interpolating a captured group into an attribute would have been stored XSS.
   *
   * Note `escapeHtml` does NOT escape `'`, which was load-bearing under the old arrangement: it was
   * safe purely because no generated attribute used single quotes. DOMPurify removes that dependency.
