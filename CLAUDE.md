# CLAUDE.md — Nuxeo Agentic UI

Angular 20 + Nx monorepo. A Nuxeo content management UI being converted into a
customer-shippable Beta ("Nuxeo Satori") on real `adf-hx` components, with a
four-layer customisation contract.

---

## Read this first, in order

1. **`AGENTS.md`** — architecture, service map, where things live.
2. **`AGENTS/11-beta-program.md`** — the Beta contract. Section 3 is _verified facts_:
   established first-hand, do not re-litigate. If you believe one is wrong, **prove it
   before acting on it** — two phases contradicted a verified fact without proof and both
   cost real time.
3. **`docs/adf-hx-beta-plan.md`** — the plan of record: phases, timelines, risks,
   decisions already taken. Supersedes `docs/adf-hx-poc-action-plan.md`.
4. The `AGENTS/` file for your task — `01-services.md`, `02-nuxeo-apis.md`,
   `05-test-standards.md`, `07-security.md`, `08-bug-patterns.md`.

For Beta work also read `docs/extension-reference.md` (the registered-ID contract) and
`libs/shared/adf-hx-bridge/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Where the programme stands

Branch `feature/adf-hx-browse-poc`, pushed, CI green. See the plan's **Programme status**
section for the authoritative, dated position — that file is maintained; this line is not.

Phases 0, 1 and 2 are complete. Phase 3 (adf-hx component adoption) is next and is the
first phase that needs the `@alfresco` package registry.

## Skills — read them, they are not auto-loaded

The workflow lives in `.cursor/skills/`. They are plain Markdown; read the relevant one
before starting.

| Skill                             | Use for                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `beta-phase/SKILL.md`             | Running any Beta phase end to end. **Start here.**         |
| `verify-gate/SKILL.md`            | Getting to green without churning                          |
| `capture-phase-evidence/SKILL.md` | Producing evidence that proves something                   |
| `implement-api-port/SKILL.md`     | One of the twelve adf-hx API ports (Phase 3, ~10 of these) |
| `adopt-adf-hx-component/SKILL.md` | Swapping a hand-written `hxp-*` for the real component     |
| `add-extension-point/SKILL.md`    | Making something manifest-addressable                      |

## The gate — six, not three

```bash
npm run beta:gate -- --phase <id>     # lockfile, guardrails, lint, test, build, typecheck
npm run beta:gate -- --gates lockfile,guardrails,lint   # fast inner loop
npm run beta:evidence -- <phase-id>   # exits non-zero if any check fails
```

Two traps that have each cost a phase:

- **`test` does not typecheck.** Vitest strips types through esbuild. Only `build` and
  `typecheck` catch a `TS` error, and they run last. A green `test` is not type safety.
- **Nothing except the `lockfile` gate reads `package-lock.json`.** CI was red for the
  whole of Phase 2 while every local gate was green.

## Hard-won rules — the expensive ones

- **A gate is not evidence until you have seen it fail on purpose.** Three gates this
  programme were green while the thing they guarded was broken: an evidence check that
  compared script `src` attributes instead of bundle bytes, a path check that was
  tautological under the dev base href, and a lockfile gate that matched dependency names
  but not versions. Break it deliberately, watch it go red, then trust it.
- **Never run a bare `npm install` and commit the lockfile.** On macOS it prunes optional
  platform entries Linux needs and `npm ci` refuses the tree. Restore a known-good lock and
  merge new entries in.
- **`npm ci` installs from each entry's `resolved` URL, not from `.npmrc`.** Changing a
  scope's registry does nothing until the lock is regenerated.
- **Evidence must assert the claim, not the pulse.** Every step records at least one check;
  state which checks are load-bearing and which are negative, so a total is not read as all
  meaningful. Anything asserting a _reloaded_ app needs a real `page.reload()` —
  `withHashLocation()` makes `goto('/#/x')` same-document, so `APP_INITIALIZER` never re-runs.
- **Do not present unfinished work as finished.** Registering descriptors nothing renders,
  or documenting rules that always return `false`, inflates the apparent surface. Both
  happened; both were caught in review.
- **Independent adversarial review is mandatory** before a phase is signed off. Every phase
  so far self-reported green and CI-green, and every one contained at least one overstated
  or self-confirming claim. Phase 1's would have shipped a dead feature to every customer.

## Non-negotiable conventions

- `standalone: true` on every component — no NgModules
- `inject()` for DI — never constructor parameters
- `signal()` for mutable state — never `BehaviorSubject` for UI state
- `takeUntilDestroyed()` on every `.subscribe()`
- `templateUrl` always — no inline templates
- Never `<img [src]="nuxeoUrl">` — fetch via service, use a blob URL, revoke on destroy
- Never cross-feature imports — shared logic goes in `libs/shared/`
- Credentials from environment only; never hardcoded, never in a URL query string
- **adf-hx types must never appear in our public API** — wrap them in `adf-hx-bridge`
- Anything a customer might want to change goes through Layer 0 or 1, not a hardcoded value
- **Hiding an action in a manifest is not a security control** — server-side Nuxeo
  permissions still gate operations

## Environment

- Nuxeo runs locally in Docker (container `nuxeo`, port 8080) with OpenSearch. The dev
  server proxies to it via `apps/nuxeo-ui/proxy.conf.json`.
- `npx nx serve nuxeo-ui` → `http://localhost:4200`.
- Credentials from `NUXEO_USER`/`NUXEO_PASS`, default `Administrator`.
- `SATORI_GH_READONLY_TOKEN` is required to install `@hylandsoftware` and `@alfresco`
  packages from GitHub Packages.
- Node is pinned to 20 (`.nvmrc`). On Node 22+ a built-in `localStorage` shadows jsdom's;
  `npm run beta:gate` works around it, a bare `nx test` does not.
- Playwright is installed with `--no-save` on purpose, so CI installs stay unaffected.
- The AI backend is **not** in this repo — AI features are `AI.*` Nuxeo Automation
  operations from a separate marketplace package. Absent package means HTTP 500, which is
  expected, not a client defect.

## Evidence

Phase evidence and leadership review packages are written to
`~/Desktop/agentic-ui-evidence/beta/` — **outside the repo**, so they do not travel with a
clone. Anything load-bearing belongs in the repo docs. Do not commit evidence output.
