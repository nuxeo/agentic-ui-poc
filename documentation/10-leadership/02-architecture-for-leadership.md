## The four things that matter strategically

### 1. The boundary is real, and it is enforced by machinery

The line between "we own it" and "the customer owns it" is not a convention — it is enforced:

| Guarantee                                   | Mechanism                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Their config survives our upgrade           | `install.xml` copies with `overwrite="false"`            |
| Their wiring survives our upgrade           | The manifest is a Nuxeo **document**, not a bundled file |
| Their code depends only on published API    | 4 entry points; a guardrail rejects deep imports         |
| Our public API cannot change by accident    | A 2,221-line snapshot gate                               |
| Their customisation survives a version bump | An upgrade rehearsal, run on every build                 |

**Why leadership should care:** this is what makes a support boundary defensible, an upgrade
shippable, and a certification claim makeable. Without it, every customer is a fork.

### 2. Nothing about the AI features runs here

The 12 `AI.*` operations are HTTP calls to Nuxeo Automation. The intelligence is in a **separate
marketplace package**. Consequences:

- **This product incurs no LLM inference cost.** Any TCO model that assigns inference cost to
  Satori is mis-attributing.
- **"AI-powered" is not true out of the box.** Absent backend ⇒ HTTP 500.
- Ownership, cost and roadmap of that backend are **a separate decision** that gates every AI
  feature in the product.

### 3. The AI harness is build-time, and it ships to customers

Two distinct things share the name:

|                 | Runtime AI          | The harness                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Audience        | End users           | Developers — ours **and the customer's**          |
| Cost            | AI backend operator | Existing AI-tool subscriptions                    |
| In the package? | Client only         | **Yes — generators + guardrail + knowledge base** |

The harness shipping _inside_ the package is the unusual move: a customer's own AI agent is
treated as a first-class user of the product.

### 4. One package, one monorepo — simpler than planned

The RFC proposed 5+ npm packages and 3 repositories. Reality: **one** package with 4 entry
points, in **one** monorepo. Fewer things to version, fewer to support, and the adf-hx bridge is
deliberately _not_ published — which is what keeps third-party types out of our public API.

## What is architecturally strong

| Strength                                           | Why it matters commercially                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Configuration survives upgrade **by construction** | Removes the single largest historical customisation complaint   |
| Customisation addressed **by ID, not class name**  | We can refactor internals without breaking customers            |
| Layer boundaries **machine-enforced**              | Prevents the architecture eroding under delivery pressure       |
| adf-hx components shared with Alfresco             | Component investment is shared, not duplicated                  |
| Verification apparatus                             | The credible answer to "how do you ship AI-written code safely" |

## What is architecturally thin

| Weakness                                     | Consequence                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No production observability**              | We could not diagnose a customer incident                     |
| **4 of 8 extension slots reserved**          | Narrower addressable surface than advertised                  |
| **Eager adf-core** — +1.15 MB initial bundle | Slower first load for every user; the real fix is deferred    |
| **No client-side caching layer**             | Every action hits Nuxeo                                       |
| **No multi-tenancy in the UI**               | Tenancy is Nuxeo's; the UI has no notion of it                |
| **AI backend is an external dependency**     | Every AI feature is gated on something we do not control here |

## Deployment, in one paragraph

The Angular application is built, assembled into a Maven marketplace package alongside a small
Java/OSGi bundle, and installed into Nuxeo. Static assets are served by Nuxeo's Tomcat. There is
**no separate server to run and no new infrastructure** — which is a genuine operational
advantage, and the reason the runtime cost delta for a customer is close to zero.

The one subtlety that has already caused a defect: the customer-editable config must land inside
the directory Tomcat actually serves, and it must not be overwritten on upgrade. An earlier
version installed to a path that is not a docBase and **would have 404'd on every install** — it
was recorded complete before that was caught, which is why the phase-state gate now exists.

---

## The strategic risk, stated once

We have built a platform for a customisation pattern **we have not yet confirmed customers want
in the shape we built it**. The architecture is sound; the open question is whether the
addressable surface matches real demand. That is RFC risk R8, it is measurable in days, and it
should be measured before further platform investment.
