# Documentation Governance

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-08-24 · **Repository:** `77265f9`

## The rule

> **No significant architectural, agent, skill, feature or integration change is complete until
> its documentation is updated.**

Not aspirational. This repository has already paid for the alternative:

- `CLAUDE.md` pointed at a **Programme status** section that did not exist, while its own summary
  claimed Phase 3 was next — three phases after Phase 3 shipped.
- Two facts in a section headed _"do not re-litigate these"_ were **false**.
- The leadership-facing delivery record was three phases stale and did not mention the published
  package once.
- `docs/agentic-development-system.md` describes 28 agents; **8 exist**.

Each was believed because it was written down.

## Why this set lives in the repository

Markdown in `documentation/`, published to Confluence by
[`scripts/publish-confluence.mjs`](https://github.com/nuxeo/agentic-ui-poc/blob/feature/adf-hx-browse-poc/scripts/publish-confluence.mjs).
Deliberate, for four reasons:

1. **It travels with the code.** A branch that changes behaviour can change its documentation in
   the same commit.
2. **It is reviewable.** Documentation changes appear in the pull request, next to the code they
   describe.
3. **It is diffable.** "What changed since the last review" is `git log`.
4. **It cannot be edited in two places.** Confluence is a rendering. Re-running the publisher
   refreshes it.

**Consequence: do not edit these pages in Confluence.** Edits there are overwritten on the next
publish. Change the Markdown.

## Ownership

| Area                                     | Owner                             | Reviews                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Engineering pages                        | The engineer making the change    | Peer on the PR                 |
| `Architecture`, `Extensibility Contract` | Tech lead                         | Required for any change        |
| Product pages                            | Product manager                   | Tech lead for factual accuracy |
| Leadership pages                         | Product manager + tech lead       | —                              |
| `Cost & TCO`                             | Whoever owns the commercial model | Tech lead for the driver list  |
| This page                                | Tech lead                         | —                              |
| The publisher script                     | Tech lead                         | —                              |

**Every page carries `last_reviewed` and `repo_commit` in frontmatter.** A page whose
`repo_commit` is far behind `main` is a page to distrust.

## What already keeps documentation honest

Documentation gates that exist today — worth knowing, because they are unusual:

| Gate                                            | Asserts                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run beta:reference`                        | Every documented extension ID is registered **and** every registered ID is documented. Fails in **both** directions |
| `npm run beta:api`                              | The published API matches its 2,221-line snapshot                                                                   |
| `staleness-check.yml`                           | `AGENTS/01-services.md` still matches the code                                                                      |
| `review:guardrails` → `checkAdfHxWorkaroundIds` | A workaround marker has a register row, and vice versa                                                              |
| `review:guardrails` → `checkDocsNumbering`      | No duplicate section numbers in `docs/`                                                                             |
| `npm run beta:state`                            | No phase claims more than its evidence supports                                                                     |
| `npm run beta:audit`                            | No evidence assertion is incapable of failing                                                                       |

**The gap:** 12 of the 13 `AGENTS/` files have no staleness check, and none of these
`documentation/` pages has one. Extending the `staleness-check.yml` pattern is the obvious next
step — the cheapest version is a check that fails when a page's `repo_commit` is more than N
commits behind `main`.

## Adding a page to this set

1. Create the Markdown under the right section directory.
2. Add frontmatter — `title`, `parent`, `order`, `last_reviewed`, `repo_commit`, `audience`.
   **A page with no `title` is skipped by the publisher.**
3. Link it from [the index](../README.md). An unlinked page is an undiscoverable page.
4. Verify the conversion before publishing:
   ```bash
   node scripts/publish-confluence.mjs --dry-run
   ```
5. Publish:
   ```bash
   export CONFLUENCE_EMAIL=you@hyland.com
   export CONFLUENCE_TOKEN_FILE=/path/to/token
   node scripts/publish-confluence.mjs
   ```
6. Read the page back in Confluence. The publisher is idempotent by title, so re-running updates
   rather than duplicating.

**Credentials never go in a file in this repository.** Use the environment or a path outside the
repo. `checkHardcodedSecrets` will fail the build on a credential-shaped literal, and there is
already one real example in the wild of a token sitting in a settings file.

---

## The standard to hold

From `CLAUDE.md`, and it applies to documentation as much as to gates:

> **Do not present unfinished work as finished.** Registering descriptors nothing renders, or
> documenting rules that always return `false`, inflates the apparent surface.

Applied here, that means three habits:

- **Mark the unverified.** "Not verified in repository" is a complete and acceptable answer.
- **Never delete a claim that turned out wrong.** Move it, and say what was believed. The record
  of what was believed is part of the record.
- **Separate demonstrated from plausible.** Every Product and Leadership page in this set does
  this explicitly, and it is the reason those pages can be handed to a customer or an executive
  without a caveat conversation first.
