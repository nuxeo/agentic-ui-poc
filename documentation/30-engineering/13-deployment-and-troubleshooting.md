## 1. What ships

Three artifacts:

| Artifact                     | Built by                           | Contains                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Marketplace package**      | Maven — `nuxeo-agentic-ui-package` | The built Angular app, the OSGi bundle, and the seed config                                                           |
| **`nuxeo-agentic-core`**     | Maven                              | 189 lines of Java/OSGi: an `AgenticNotificationDocumentIdCodec`, an auth-config fragment, a login start-page fragment |
| **`@nuxeo-satori/platform`** | `nx build platform`                | The npm package customers depend on. 347 kB, 25 files, 4 entry points. **`private: true` — not yet published**        |

`pom.xml` is a Maven parent over three modules: `apps/nuxeo-ui`, `nuxeo-agentic-core`,
`nuxeo-agentic-ui-package`.

```bash
npx nx build nuxeo-ui --configuration=production
mvn package                       # produces the marketplace ZIP
npx nx build platform             # produces dist/libs/platform
```

CI: `build-marketplace.yml` (3 jobs) on PR and manual dispatch — it does not run on merge to
`main`, and publishes to Marketplace preprod only when dispatched with `publishToPreprod`
checked, which `release.yml` (also manual) does for a release.

---

## 2. `install.xml` — the most consequential 20 lines in the repository

```xml
<install>
  <update file="${package.root}/install/bundles" todir="${env.bundles}" />
  <copy dir="${package.root}/web" todir="${env.server.home}/nxserver" overwrite="true" />
</install>
```

Two steps, and **no configuration file**. Since NXSAT-312 configuration is contributed by
Marketplace packages to an extension point and served by a servlet; nothing is edited on the
server and nothing is read from the repository.

### Where configuration comes from

The `nuxeo-agentic-core` bundle declares the component `org.nuxeo.agentic.ui.config` with the
extension point `configuration`, and contributes our defaults to it as one ordinary contribution,
`org.nuxeo.agentic.ui.config.defaults`
(`agentic-ui-config/bootstrap.defaults.json`, `manifest.defaults.json`). A customer ships their own
package:

- `package.xml` declares a dependency on `nuxeo-agentic-ui`, which orders installation;
- its component `<require>`s `org.nuxeo.agentic.ui.config.defaults`, which orders the
  contributions, so the browser applies theirs after ours;
- it contributes `<fragment name layer="bootstrap|manifest" src|<json>>`,
  `<layout type mode src|<json>>` and `<asset name src>` (an image their logo can name). `src`
  is read from their bundle.

A later fragment with the same name and layer replaces the earlier one in place; a later layout
with the same type and mode replaces the file whole; `enabled="false"` removes either. The full
contract is in [`docs/extension-reference.md`](../../docs/extension-reference.md).

### What the servlet serves

`AgenticUiConfigServlet` is mapped at `/agentic-ui-config/*` by the bundle's deployment fragment
(`web#SERVLET`, `web#SERVLET-MAPPING`). A servlet mapping is more specific than Tomcat's default
servlet, so it alone answers for that path; nothing on disk under
`nxserver/nuxeo.war/agentic-ui-config` is served.

| Path                                | Body                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bootstrap.json`, `manifest.json`   | Envelope `nuxeo-agentic-ui-config/1`: ordered `fragments`, `diagnostics`, and for bootstrap the `assets` |
| `layouts.json`                      | Index of the layouts in force                                                                            |
| `layouts/<type>/<mode>.layout.json` | The layout file in force, whole                                                                          |
| `assets/<name>`                     | A contributed image, with its own content type                                                           |

Every fragment and asset carries its provenance — contributing component, bundle and `src` (or
`inline`). Every 200 has an `ETag` that hashes the body, which is fixed for as long as the
configuration built at startup stands, plus `Cache-Control: no-cache`,
`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and a `sandbox` CSP. `If-None-Match` answers 304. GET and HEAD
only. A fragment that is not a JSON object, is larger than 1 MiB, or
cannot be read is left out and reported in `diagnostics`; the server still starts. When such a
fragment, layout or asset was meant to replace an earlier one, the earlier one stays in force where
it was, and a `kept` warning says so.

**Anonymous by design.** The application reads its configuration before sign-in, so no
authentication filter is mapped on the path. **Nothing sensitive may be contributed** — every
fragment is public.

### No migration from `bootstrap.json` or the Note

The old mechanism — a `bootstrap.json` edited beside the bundle, and a manifest Note at
`/default-domain/config/agentic-ui` — is **removed with no migration**, in two steps that ship
together. The server side (NXSAT-312 slice 1) stops serving files from disk: a file left in
`nxserver/nuxeo.war/agentic-ui-config` is not read, served or reported. The client side (slice 2)
stops reading the Note: the application makes no request for it, before or after sign-in, and
applies only the fragments the server serves. A Note left in the repository is inert. Anyone
using either must re-create their settings in a configuration package, or as a preset in a demo
package. `npx nx g @nuxeo-satori/platform:config-package <name> --owner=<owner>` scaffolds one
(in a clone of this repository, before the platform package is published:
`npx nx g ./tools/satori-generators:config-package <name> --owner=<owner>`),
and `npx nx build <name>` checks its fragments and writes the zip `nuxeoctl mp-install` takes;
`config-packages/presales-demo` is the demo package presales installs.

### How the application loads it

At startup, before anything renders and before anyone signs in, the application fetches
`agentic-ui-config/bootstrap.json` and `manifest.json` — siblings, resolved from its base href —
in parallel and anonymously. It folds each response's fragments over its compiled defaults in the
order served, then applies a presales preset if a package enables switching and one is chosen.
Nothing is fetched again when a user signs in, out, or switches: both halves are the same for
everyone. Only the `nuxeo-agentic-ui-config/1` envelope is accepted; a bare JSON object, an error
status, an unreachable server or one that does not answer within 10 s leaves the compiled defaults
in force, and `AppConfigService.diagnostics()` records why. Every reason, and every diagnostic the server
reports, is also written to the browser console as a warning prefixed `[agentic-ui-config]`. The
template app's home page lists the package behind every fragment. "Anonymously" means neither URL
needs credentials: once a user has signed in with a password, the auth interceptor adds them to
these requests as it does to every `/nuxeo/` request, and the servlet ignores them.

Under `nx serve` there is no servlet: `npm run config:dev` writes both files, as envelopes, into
the gitignored `apps/nuxeo-ui/public/agentic-ui-config/`, from our defaults plus any fragment
files given. Run it before starting the dev server, which serves only files that existed when it
started.

### Why the package installs no file a customer edits (NXSAT-317)

`overwrite="false"` broke the upgrade when it was used to protect an edited `bootstrap.json`. An
upgrade is an uninstall of the old version, which deletes each package file only while its md5
still matches, then an install of the new one, whose `overwrite="false"` copy throws on the file
left behind. The install rolls back only its own commands: **no version is installed** and
`/nuxeo/agentic-ui/` returns 404. `review-guardrails.mjs` (`checkInstallerOwnsNoCustomerFile`)
refuses any non-overwriting copy, any copy into `agentic-ui-config`, and any `src/main/config`
directory in the package.

### Why the web destination is what it is

The `nuxeo` context declares `docBase="../nxserver/nuxeo.war"`, so `/nuxeo/agentic-ui/` resolves
to `nxserver/nuxeo.war/agentic-ui/`. **`nxserver/web` holds only `root.war` and is not a docBase —
anything placed there is never served.** An earlier version shipped `nxserver/web/…` and would have
404'd on every install.

> **Changing `install.xml` or marketplace packaging is a hard stop** in the phase skill — escalate
> rather than attempt it. The reasoning above is why.

### Diagnosis limits, stated honestly

There is **no APM, structured logging, metrics export or error reporting**. In a customer
environment you have: the browser console, Nuxeo's server logs, and whatever the user tells you.
That is the largest operational gap in the product — see
[Scalability & Operations](../10-leadership/06-scalability-and-operations.md).

## 6. Publishing the platform package

Deliberately deferred. `private: true` is the last thing standing between a mistyped
`npm publish` and a public release of an unfinished package.

- Scope and registry are **decided**: `@nuxeo/satori-platform` on
  `https://packages.nuxeo.com/repository/npm-public/` — the registry `nuxeo-elements` already
  publishes to.
- Runbook: [`docs/publishing-to-nuxeo-registry.md`](https://github.com/nuxeo/agentic-ui-poc/blob/feature/adf-hx-browse-poc/docs/publishing-to-nuxeo-registry.md)
- Readiness and what is deliberately not done: [`docs/publish-readiness.md`](https://github.com/nuxeo/agentic-ui-poc/blob/feature/adf-hx-browse-poc/docs/publish-readiness.md)

Before publishing, `npm run beta:publishable` must pass. It runs a real `npm publish --dry-run`,
which is **the only check that executes `prepublishOnly`** — and for the whole of Phase 4 the
package could not be published at all because it was compiled in full compilation mode, while six
other gates were green.

## 7. Rollback

**Not verified in repository.** Marketplace package rollback is presumably Nuxeo's standard
mechanism, but nothing here tests it and no runbook exists. The _upgrade_ path is tested on every
build by `beta:upgrade`; the rollback path is not.

Worth establishing before a customer goes live, alongside the observability gap.
