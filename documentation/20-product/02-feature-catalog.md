# Feature Catalog

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-08-24 · **Repository:** `77265f9`
> Derived from the 23 application routes, the 9 feature libraries and the 25 Nuxeo services.
> Every row is traceable to code. Where a capability is present but limited, the limit is
> stated rather than omitted.

## How to read this

- **Status: Shipped** — implemented and exercised by evidence or E2E.
- **Status: Shipped, limited** — works, with a stated boundary.
- **Status: Present, unproven** — code exists; no evidence run or test covers it.
- **Status: Backend absent** — the client exists; the server-side implementation is in a
  **separate package not in this repository**.
- **Status: Reserved** — declared, nothing reads it. Not a capability.

> **Permissions limitation.** The UI reads and displays permissions and can add, update and
> delete them. But the Layer 1 **rule context** still carries selection _ids_ rather than
> documents, so `app.rules.canWriteSelection` and `canRemoveSelection` answer `false`
> everywhere. Bulk permission-gated actions are therefore not manifest-gateable yet.

> An adversarial review found an injection that returned 155 documents against 0 for the
> plain term, defeating the `isVersion`/`isTrashed` hygiene filters. Nuxeo's ACL filter
> bounded the impact — no unauthorised documents were readable — but versions and trashed
> documents became visible. Fixed, with an E2E regression guard.

## 7. Runtime AI features — 12 operations

**All 12 depend on a backend package that is not in this repository.** Absent package ⇒
HTTP 500, which is expected. Feature-flagged client-side
(`ai-feature-flag.service`, `sessionStorage` key `ai-features-enabled`).

| Operation           | Capability                                | Status             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------ |

| `AI.Summarize`      | Document summary                          | **Backend absent** |
| `AI.SuggestTags`    | Tag suggestions                           | **Backend absent** |

| `AI.Sentiment`      | Sentiment                                 | **Backend absent** |
| `AI.Anomalies`      | Anomaly detection                         | **Backend absent** |
| `AI.AuditSummarize` | Summarise audit history                   | **Backend absent** |
| `AI.AuditNlFilter`  | NL filtering of audit entries             | **Backend absent** |
| `AI.NlPermissions`  | NL permission queries                     | **Backend absent** |

## Capabilities hidden in the tooling

Easy to miss, and part of the product for a customer who forks:

| Capability                                             | Where                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A customer's agent can scaffold a conforming extension | 4 generators, shipped in the package                                   |
| …and verify its own work before human review           | `check-extension-library.mjs`, 5 checks                                |
| …guided by a versioned knowledge base                  | `libs/platform/AGENTS.md` + the extension reference, shipped as assets |
| Contract drift is detectable                           | `beta:reference` — fails in **both** directions                        |
| Upgrade safety is testable by the customer             | The rehearsal pattern is reproducible in their CI                      |

## What is deliberately out of scope for Beta

From RFC §1: **workflow, users and groups, administration and publishing are out of scope**
for the Beta slice.

Note the tension worth flagging to product: administration and publishing surfaces **are
implemented** in this repository (see §4 above, ~7.3k lines) even though the RFC scopes them
out. That is extra delivered value, but it is also surface area that is not covered by the
Beta quality bar — `administration` sits at 62.1% line coverage with 3 spec files.
