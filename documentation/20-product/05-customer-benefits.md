# Customer Benefits

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-08-24 · **Repository:** `77265f9`

> **The rule for this page:** a benefit is listed as _demonstrated_ only if something in the
> repository proves the mechanism works. Everything else is _plausible but unvalidated_, and
> said so. **No customer has used this product, so no benefit has been observed in the
> field** — and no percentage or time-saving figure appears here, because none has been
> measured.

## A. Demonstrated — the mechanism is proven in the repository

These are safe to state to a customer, with the caveat that they are proven _mechanically_,
not _commercially_.

| Benefit                                                    | What is proven                                                                                                            | Evidence                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rebranding needs no code and no rebuild**                | Theme tokens, branding, languages load from `bootstrap.json` before authentication and apply as CSS custom properties     | `phase-1-config`, 39 checks                                   |
| **Reconfiguring the addressable surface needs no rebuild** | A manifest edit adds, hides, relabels and reorders nav entries and actions                                                | `phase-2-registry`, 46 checks                                 |
| **Configuration survives a product upgrade**               | `install.xml` seeds config with `overwrite="false"`; the Layer 1 manifest is a Nuxeo document, not a bundled file         | `beta:upgrade`; the reasoning is recorded at the code         |
| **Customisation survives a version bump**                  | 21 customer files byte-identical; the app still compiles; every manifest-named slot still exists                          | `npm run beta:upgrade`, 8 assertions, with a negative control |
| **Customer code stays in the customer's repository**       | One publishable package, 4 entry points, 10 declared peers; the customer's library depends on it and nothing else of ours | `beta:fork`, `beta:publishable`                               |
| **The customisation contract cannot drift silently**       | 52 IDs documented and registered; the gate fails in **both** directions                                                   | `npm run beta:reference`                                      |
| **Configuration inherits Nuxeo's governance**              | The manifest is a Nuxeo document, so it gets versioning, audit trail, ACLs and per-tenant scoping without new machinery   | Design + `phase-2-registry`                                   |
| **Extension scaffolding is correct by default**            | Generators produce registered, tested libraries — verified from the published tarball, not the source tree                | `phase-5-harness`, 27 checks                                  |
| **A customer's agent can verify its own conformance**      | 5 checks, each corresponding to a real mistake, each probed                                                               | `beta:customer-guardrails`                                    |
| **Modern stack removes the Polymer dead end**              | Angular 20, standalone components, signals, Nx, real module boundaries                                                    | The codebase                                                  |
| **UI visibility is not mistaken for security**             | 3 security-relevant rules fail **closed**; server-side ACLs remain the boundary                                           | `extension-rules.ts`, and the fail-closed list                |

## B. Plausible but unvalidated — do not state as fact

Each of these is the _intended_ benefit. None is measured, and the first is the one the
commercial case rests on.

| Claimed benefit                                            | Why it is unvalidated                                                                                                                          | How to validate it                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Most customer requests are satisfied by Layers 0 and 1** | The **central economic assumption**. Flagged as unvalidated in both the RFC and the plan. If false, every engagement becomes a Layer 2 project | Take 10 real requests from The Church and one other account; attempt each as Layer 0/1 only; count fall-through          |
| Reduced engineering dependency for customers               | Follows from the above. Untested                                                                                                               | Same exercise                                                                                                            |
| Faster customisation delivery                              | No before/after measurement exists for any customer                                                                                            | Instrument one PS engagement: hours by layer                                                                             |
| Lower total cost of ownership                              | No cost model with real inputs exists                                                                                                          | See [Cost & TCO](../10-leadership/03-cost-and-tco.md) — it provides the framework, deliberately without invented numbers |
| Reduced support burden                                     | Depends on the support boundary holding in practice, which needs a real customer on a real upgrade                                             | First customer upgrade                                                                                                   |
| Faster onboarding of customer developers                   | The knowledge base and generators exist and ship. No one outside this team has used them                                                       | Have a PS engineer build a customisation using only the published package                                                |
| "The 52 registered IDs are the right ones"                 | RFC risk **R8** explicitly: too few addressable IDs caps customisation and pushes work into Layer 2                                            | The 10-request exercise again                                                                                            |
| Improved consistency across customer implementations       | Plausible — generators enforce a shape. Unobserved                                                                                             | Two engagements, compared                                                                                                |

## C. Benefits that are currently blocked

Honest, and each has an owner in Phase 6 or a decision.

| Blocked benefit                               | Blocker                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Where it is tracked                                                           |

## D. The benefit that is real but rarely articulated

**The verification apparatus is itself an asset**, and it is transferable.

The programme's own history is the evidence, from RFC §7.1: the POC produced ~18,400 lines
quickly, and with them **seven code-level defects, eleven tests for 2,949 lines of bridge
source, and a branch never compiled by CI**.

What exists now instead: 15 gates, 10 commit-time guardrails, a falsifiability audit over 257
evidence assertions, two read-only review agents, and a requirement for adversarial review
before any phase is signed off. That apparatus found, in already-signed-off work:

- a published package that **could not be published at all**;
- 27 wrongly non-nullable public types;
- four cross-boundary imports the module-boundary rule had never been able to reject;
- nine security defects across blob-URL lifecycles, subscription teardown and one `<img [src]>`
  bypassing the HTTP interceptor;
- **seven gates that asserted less than they claimed**.

For a customer adopting an agentic workflow on their own fork, that pattern — not the speed —
is the reusable part. The RFC's conclusion is the honest sentence to use:

> **Agents move cost from authoring to verification rather than removing it.**

## E. How to talk about benefits externally

| Do                                                                                                       | Don't                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Rebranding is a configuration change, and we test that it survives upgrades"                            | "Customisation is free"                                 |
| "Customer code lives in your repository against a versioned API"                                         | "No development needed"                                 |
| "We measured accessibility, we meet AA on every surface we scanned, and here is exactly what we scanned" | Claim blanket compliance and hope nobody asks for scope |
| "The AI features require the AI backend package"                                                         | "AI-powered out of the box"                             |
| "Layers 0 and 1 are designed to cover most requests — we want to validate that against your backlog"     | "Most requests need no code"                            |
| "No customer has used this yet; we are looking for a design partner"                                     | Imply production adoption                               |

The last row is the most important. **Zero customers** is the single biggest gap in every
benefit claim on this page, and framing the Beta as a design-partner search converts that
weakness into the actual ask.
