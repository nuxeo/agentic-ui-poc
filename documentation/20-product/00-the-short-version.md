# Nuxeo Agentic UI — the short version

For presales engineers, customers and partners. It takes about five minutes, describes what the
`main` branch does today (checked on 7 October 2026 at `8be3182`; only the permission-level item
under "What it does not do today" was re-checked on 9 October, at `97c6794`), and leaves the longer
documents to the end.

## What it is

Nuxeo Agentic UI is a modern web interface for a Nuxeo content repository. It runs in the
browser, talks to your Nuxeo server, and is delivered as a Nuxeo Marketplace package. It is in
Beta, so things can still change.

You will also see it called **Nuxeo Satori**. That is the programme name, and it is the title the
Marketplace listing shows today; the package itself is `nuxeo-agentic-ui`. It is not called
"Agentic AI". "Agentic" describes how it is built and customised — by AI coding agents following
written rules — not the AI features inside it, which are optional.

## What it does

The everyday work of a Nuxeo user:

- browse folders, search (full text, filters, saved searches) and open a document to preview it;
- create, upload, edit, move, copy and delete documents, and restore them from the trash;
- versions, permissions, history, comments, tags, collections, favorites and publishing;
- see and act on your workflow tasks;
- manage users, groups and vocabularies;
- in seven languages: English, French, German, Japanese, Dutch, Thai and Simplified Chinese.

Some features need server components this package does not include. The AI features
(natural-language search, summaries, tag suggestions, chat) need a separate Nuxeo package,
Knowledge Discovery needs its own backend, and the annotation viewer needs ARender. Without them
those features do not work, and the rest of the application does.

## The four "layers", in plain words

The longer documents sort every change into four numbered layers:

| Layer | In plain words                                                                                                  | Code?                  | Rebuild the app?    |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| 0     | **Settings**: product name, colours, language, on-screen wording                                                | No                     | No                  |
| 1     | **Arrangement**: which menu entries, buttons, tabs and columns appear, in what order, under what name, for whom | No                     | No                  |
| 2     | **Your own code**: new screens, new actions, your own conditions                                                | Yes, written by you    | Yes, your own build |
| 3     | **Help for AI coding agents**: instructions, code generators and checks that make layer 2 quicker to write      | Ships with the package | —                   |

On this page, layers 0 and 1 are "configuration" and layers 2 and 3 are "code".

## Where configuration lives today

Configuration has two parts:

1. **The settings** (bootstrap): the name, logo, colours and default language.
2. **The manifest**, which holds the wording and the whole arrangement.

Since NXSAT-312 you ship both in **your own Marketplace package that depends on ours**. It
contributes configuration fragments, and the server serves them after our defaults, in dependency
order. Nothing is edited on the server and nothing is stored in the Nuxeo content repository. The
application reads both at startup, before sign-in, so they are the same for every user (except on a
demo server whose package turns on presales presets, where a preset applies per browser) and must
hold nothing secret. Users see a change the next time they open the application. An edited
`bootstrap.json` beside the bundle and the old manifest Note are not read, and nothing converts
them. A generator scaffolds such a package: [the guide for
extenders](../../libs/platform/AGENTS.md#2-start-with-a-generator) gives the three commands, and
`config-packages/presales-demo` in this repository is a finished example. Until the developer
package is published, run the generator from a clone of this repository as
`npx nx g ./tools/satori-generators:config-package acme-config --owner=acme`; the
`@nuxeo-satori/platform:` form in that guide resolves from the published package, and in a clone
only after `npx nx run platform:sync-generators`. What it writes is plain JSON, XML and a build
script with no dependencies, so it can live in your own repository.

The conditions are a fixed list that ships with the product; adding your own is code. Every name
that configuration can address is listed in the
[extension reference](../../docs/extension-reference.md).

For example, this manifest fragment hides Trash, renames Collections to "Repository", and
shows Administration to administrators only:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "extensions": {
    "overrides": {
      "app.navbar.trash": { "visible": false },
      "app.navbar.collections": { "label": "Repository" },
      "app.navbar.administration": { "rule": "app.rules.isAdministrator" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Two things configuration deliberately does not do

- **Change what a shipped button does.** You can rename, move or hide a shipped button but not
  make it do something else, because otherwise a button reading "Add to favorites" could delete
  the document and Nuxeo would allow it, since the user really has that permission. Changing
  behaviour is code, where the change is reviewed and versioned.
- **Restrict what people can do.** Hiding a button changes what the screen offers, not what the
  server allows. Nuxeo checks permissions on every operation, so restrict access with Nuxeo
  permissions.

## What it does not do today

- **Change every mark.** The settings fragment's `branding.logo` replaces the header word mark
  and the sign-in page logo
  ([pull request #307](https://github.com/nuxeo/agentic-ui-poc/pull/307)). The small mark at the
  top of the navigation rail and the "Content Innovation Cloud" title shown when the rail is
  expanded belong to the Satori design system and stay, and so does the browser-tab icon.
- **Edit the fields of your own document types.** The Properties panel shows a type's own fields,
  generated from its schemas or arranged by a layout file in your package
  ([extension reference, per-type layouts](../../docs/extension-reference.md#9b-per-type-layouts--which-properties-a-document-type-shows)),
  but read-only. The edit form is the same standard fields for every type.
- **Install from a public registry.** The Marketplace package has only been published to Nuxeo's
  pre-production Marketplace. The developer package your own code builds against,
  `@nuxeo-satori/platform`, is not on any npm registry yet.
- **Run your own code inside the shipped application.** See the next section.
- **Edit every permission level on the rail's Browse page.** That page is still the adf-hx proof
  of concept, and its Permissions tab handles only Nuxeo's Read, ReadWrite and Everything. On a
  folder that also carries any other permission it refuses to save rather than delete that entry.
  The Permissions tab on a document's own page, and on `/browse`, offers all of Nuxeo's standard
  permissions and the others the server reports
  ([extension reference, section 13](../../docs/extension-reference.md#13-what-beta-does-not-yet-address)).

## What needs code

- a new screen or panel, or what a tab shows;
- a button or bulk action that does something new (configuration can place a button only for an
  action that code has registered);
- your own conditions, such as "the user is in the legal team";
- changing what a shipped button does;
- screens specific to your document types, and a form that edits their own fields.

Today a developer writes an Angular library against `@nuxeo-satori/platform`, starting from the
code generators that ship with it, and adds it to an application built from our template app,
`apps/nuxeo-satori-template`. That code does not plug into the shipped application, and because
the package is not published yet, you build it from this repository. Publishing it is planned.

## How to start

1. **Run it.** On your own machine, against Nuxeo in Docker: follow
   [Developer Getting Started](../30-engineering/01-getting-started.md). You need Docker,
   Node.js 20, and a GitHub token that can read Hyland's and Alfresco's GitHub Packages.
2. **Change something without code.** Locally, put the example above in a file and run
   `npm run config:dev -- --manifest <file>` before `nx serve`
   ([Part 0.6 of the runbook](../../docs/beta-demo-runbook.md#06-write-the-dev-configuration)).
   On a server, contribute the same JSON as a fragment from your own package. Beats 3 to 7 of the
   [demo runbook](../../docs/beta-demo-runbook.md#part-4--the-demo-script) give the exact JSON
   for each change and what you should see.
3. **Customise it with an AI coding agent.** Use the
   [Nuxeo Agentic UI prompt library](https://github.com/nuxeo-sandbox/nuxeo-agentic-ui-prompts),
   started by Nuxeo presales. Its rule is that the agent reads our source but never changes it,
   and writes everything into your own Marketplace package that depends on `nuxeo-agentic-ui`.
   Its branding prompt was written before NXSAT-312 and copies a settings file onto the server,
   which is no longer read; put the same JSON in your package's `bootstrap.json` fragment instead.
   Prompts are collected there rather than in this repository.
