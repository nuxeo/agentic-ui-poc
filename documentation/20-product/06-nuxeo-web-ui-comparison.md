# Nuxeo Satori vs. Nuxeo Web UI

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-08-24 · **Repository:** `77265f9`

## A caveat that governs this whole page

**This repository contains Satori, not the Web UI.** Every claim about Satori below is
traceable to code at `77265f9`. Claims about the Web UI come from
[RFC §2](https://hyland.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~71202090f2a61ef96d4f57a5104efe296c1f5b/pages/4256993484)
and from the team's own six weeks of Web UI maintenance recorded in Confluence — they are
**second-hand here** and are marked where they are load-bearing.

Anything I could not ground is marked **Not verified**. Please correct rather than repeat.

## The short answer

> **Satori exists because the Web UI cannot be customised economically.**

RFC §2, verbatim:

> They either fight the aging Polymer stack of the existing Web UI, which is a customisation
> dead end, or go fully headless and rebuild everything. That costs deals and blocks
> expansion in strategic accounts.

Satori is not primarily a better-looking Web UI. It is a **customisation contract** with a
content UI attached. If a customer never customises, the case for switching is much weaker —
and that is worth saying to a prospect rather than hiding.

## "Why would a customer use this instead of, alongside, or on top of the Web UI?"

The honest answer differs by case.

### Instead of — the strong case

A customer who wants a **branded, customised content experience** and is currently either
fighting Polymer or considering a headless rebuild. For them:

- Rebranding is a JSON + CSS-variable change with no build (Layer 0).
- Adding, hiding, relabelling or reordering navigation and actions is a manifest edit with no
  build (Layer 1).
- A genuinely new component is their own library against a versioned API — **their repo,
  their build, their support boundary** — instead of a fork of ours.
- Their customisation survives our upgrades, and that promise is tested by a gate rather
  than asserted in a document.

### Alongside — the realistic near-term case

Satori is a **deep core slice**, not the whole Web UI. Workflow is out of Beta scope; admin
and publishing are implemented but outside the quality bar. A customer with mature Web UI
workflows will most plausibly run Satori for the branded end-user content experience and keep
the Web UI for what Satori does not yet cover.

**This is the most likely Beta shape and should be planned for**, not treated as a failure
mode. Both install as marketplace packages against the same Nuxeo.

### On top of — not a supported pattern

There is no embedding, no shared shell and no cross-navigation between the two.
**Not verified in repository**, and nothing suggests it is intended.

---

## Where Satori is genuinely better

Each verifiable in this repository:

1. **Configuration survives upgrade by construction.** `install.xml` with
   `overwrite="false"`, and the reasoning recorded at the code — including why the obvious
   destination is wrong (`nxserver/web` is not a Tomcat docBase, so a file there is never
   served; an earlier version would have 404'd on every install).
2. **The customisation surface is a contract, and drift is detectable.**
   `npm run beta:reference` fails if a documented ID is unregistered **or** a registered ID
   is undocumented.
3. **The upgrade promise is tested.** `npm run beta:upgrade` installs, customises across
   Layers 0–2, bumps the version, reinstalls, and asserts the customisation survived —
   including that every slot the JSON manifest names still exists.
4. **Modern stack, modern tooling.** Angular 20 signals, Nx, 17 gates, real module
   boundaries.
5. **A customer's AI agent is a first-class user.** Generators and a runnable guardrail ship
   inside the package.

---

## Where the Web UI is better today

Stated plainly, because a comparison that finds no weaknesses is not credible.

1. **Breadth.** The Web UI is the mature product. Satori is a slice, and workflow is out of
   scope.
2. **Maturity and proof.** Years of production customers versus **zero**.
3. **Accessibility.** Satori has _measured_ itself and **meets WCAG 2.1 AA on the fifteen cases
   scanned** (2026-08-24). The Web UI's position is **Not verified**. This is now a strength
   rather than a weakness — but the honest form of the claim names its scope: dialogs, the upload
   flow, dark mode and the pre-auth login surface are not covered, and one remaining violation
   belongs to `@alfresco/adf-core`.
4. **Studio integration.** Nuxeo Studio's relationship to Satori is **Not verified in
   repository** — no Studio integration exists here. For a customer whose configuration lives
   in Studio, this is a material open question.
5. **Test coverage.** 3 of 15 measurable Satori projects meet the 90% bar substantively.
6. **No AI backend in the box.** The 12 `AI.*` operations need a separate package.

## One number worth carrying into any comparison conversation

The RFC's own retrospective on the POC that preceded this work:

> It was AI-built and produced roughly 18,400 lines quickly. It also produced seven
> code-level defects, eleven tests for 2,949 lines of bridge source, and a branch that had
> never been compiled by CI.

That is the _before_ picture. The 17 gates, the evidence harness and the adversarial review
process all exist because of it. When comparing developer experience, the relevant claim is
not "AI wrote it fast" — it is **"the verification apparatus is now strong enough that fast
authoring is safe"**, and that apparatus is the transferable asset.
