# Nuxeo Satori Beta — Documentation Home

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-08-24 · **Repository:** `77265f9` on `feature/adf-hx-browse-poc`
> (111 commits ahead of `main`, draft PR #145)

This is the authoritative documentation set for **Nuxeo Satori** — the Angular content
management UI being converted into a customer-shippable Beta on real `adf-hx` components,
with a four-layer customisation contract.

It exists because the product was built largely through AI-assisted development, and the
knowledge that accumulated sat in code comments, 29 scattered documents, and the heads of
two or three people. These pages consolidate that into something three different audiences
can each use on their own.

## The one thing to understand first

**There are two entirely separate AI systems in this repository, and conflating them
produces wrong conclusions about cost, risk and customer value.**

When a document says "the AI harness", it means the **second** one unless it says
otherwise. The customer-facing AI features are always called "runtime AI features".

## How to read the evidence markers

Every load-bearing technical claim in these pages carries one of:

- **A file reference** — `libs/shared/extensions/src/lib/extension-slots.ts:49`. Verified
  by reading that file at commit `77265f9`.
- **A command** — `npm run beta:state`. Verified by running it.
- **"Not verified in repository"** — stated explicitly. The claim may still be true; it is
  simply not something this repository demonstrates. Treat it as an open question, not a
  fact.
- **"Planned, not implemented"** — the repository contains a design for it and no
  implementation. Used heavily in [Skills, Agents & Generators](30-engineering/09-skills-agents-generators.md),
  because the pre-existing agent catalog describes 18 agents of which 8 exist.

Nothing in these pages is a projection dressed as a measurement. Where a number would be
useful and does not exist, the page says how to obtain it rather than estimating it.

## What this documentation supersedes

These pages are now authoritative. The following pre-existing documents remain in the
repository as history and are cited where their detail is still the best available, but
should not be read as current status:

| Document                                                                              | Status                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`docs/agentic-development-system.md`](../docs/agentic-development-system.md)         | Design plan, 1,731 lines. Its 18-agent catalog is largely target-state — see [Skills, Agents & Generators](30-engineering/09-skills-agents-generators.md) for what exists |
| [`docs/agentic-system-guide.md`](../docs/agentic-system-guide.md)                     | File-by-file guide, still broadly accurate; superseded by [Skills, Agents & Generators](30-engineering/09-skills-agents-generators.md)                                    |
| [`docs/developer-guide.md`](../docs/developer-guide.md)                               | Still the best detail on component and service patterns; superseded for setup by [Getting Started](30-engineering/01-getting-started.md)                                  |
| [`docs/technical-walkthrough.md`](../docs/technical-walkthrough.md)                   | Presentation walkthrough; superseded by [Architecture](30-engineering/02-architecture.md)                                                                                 |
| [`docs/architecture.md`](../docs/architecture.md)                                     | 54 lines, thin; superseded by [Architecture](30-engineering/02-architecture.md)                                                                                           |
| [`docs/adf-hx-poc-action-plan.md`](../docs/adf-hx-poc-action-plan.md)                 | Explicitly superseded by `docs/adf-hx-beta-plan.md` in its own header                                                                                                     |
| [`docs/consolidated-agentic-ai-report.md`](../docs/consolidated-agentic-ai-report.md) | Retrospective with a cost-benefit section; cited by [Cost & TCO](10-leadership/03-cost-and-tco.md)                                                                        |

**Still authoritative and not superseded**, because they are maintained and gated:

- [`docs/adf-hx-beta-plan.md`](../docs/adf-hx-beta-plan.md) — the plan of record, with a
  dated Programme status section
- [`docs/extension-reference.md`](../docs/extension-reference.md) — the customer-facing
  registered-ID contract, gated by `npm run beta:reference`
- [`docs/api/platform.api.md`](../docs/api/platform.api.md) — the published API snapshot,
  gated by `npm run beta:api`
- [`AGENTS/`](../AGENTS) and [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) — the agent contract. Read by AI
  tools on every task; these pages describe it but do not replace it
- [`docs/adf-hx-workarounds.md`](../docs/adf-hx-workarounds.md) and
  [`docs/adf-hx-upstream-findings.md`](../docs/adf-hx-upstream-findings.md) — both gated
  in `scripts/review-guardrails.mjs`

## Keeping this true

See [Documentation Governance](40-governance/01-documentation-governance.md). The short
version, and the rule worth adopting:

> **No significant architectural, agent, skill, feature or integration change is complete
> until its documentation is updated.**

This set is authored as Markdown inside the repository and published to Confluence from
there — deliberately, so the documentation travels with the code, is reviewable in a pull
request, and cannot drift silently from the thing it describes. The Confluence pages are a
rendering, not the source.
