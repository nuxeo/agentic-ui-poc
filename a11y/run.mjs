/**
 * The single entry point for everything in this folder.
 *
 * `package.json` at the repository root carries exactly one line for this folder —
 * `"a11y:scan": "node a11y/run.mjs"` — and every suite and diagnostic is a subcommand here
 * rather than a script of its own. That is the whole reason this file exists: the
 * `package.json` part of removing this folder is one line, not hunting seven npm entries.
 * (Removal also edits `docs/accessibility.md`; `README.md` has the full list.)
 *
 * The pre-existing `a11y`, `a11y:all` and `a11y:baseline` scripts are NOT ours. They drive
 * `scripts/a11y-scan.mjs`, the static template scan, which is CI-gated and permanent.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run a11y:scan -- <command>
