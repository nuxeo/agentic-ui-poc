/**
 * Is this surface worth measuring? — the Node-side twin of `expectSurfaceUsable` in
 * `fixtures.ts`.
 *
 * The diagnostics used to wait only for the feature host to become visible. That is not
 * enough, and the reason is specific rather than theoretical: a failed load renders the *same
 * host* with an error panel inside it, so the host is visible and the check passes. The
 * `/nuxeo/api/v1/me` preflight does not close the gap either — it proves credentials and the
 * backend are reachable, not that this route's data request succeeded.
 *
 * What that produced, per diagnostic:
 *
 *   - `reflow-probe.mjs` measured the geometry of an error panel and reported `fits`. An
 *     error panel has a perfectly well-behaved layout; it is the one thing guaranteed not to
 *     overflow.
 *   - `axe-differential.mjs` ran both tag sets against an error DOM and recorded the route as
 *     measured, so a rule that only fires on real content read as "did not reproduce".
 *
 * Both are false-clean, which is the failure mode this whole folder exists to avoid. Flagged
 * in review on PR #225.
 *
 * This module is the single definition of both lists below and of `screenUnsettledReason`, the
 * wait every scan makes before measuring; `fixtures.ts` imports them, which is why the folder
 * sets `allowJs`. It is `.mjs` rather than `.ts` so the diagnostics, which are plain Node
 * scripts and never see the TypeScript compiler, can import it too.
 */

/**
 * Every class that means "this surface failed to load".
 *
 * There is no shared error component in this application — each feature rolls its own — so
 * this list is the closest thing to one, and it is maintained by sweeping the templates
 * rather than by memory. That distinction is not pedantic: the list was written by hand from
 * the features that had already been scanned, the comment above it claimed it had been
 * collected from the templates, and it was missing twenty classes. `.widget-error` was found
 * in review on PR #225 — the dashboard renders it in four places, so a dashboard whose
 * widgets had all failed rendered plenty of text, tripped no selector here, and would have
 * been scanned and reported as a clean surface.
 *
 * `diagnostics/error-class-drift.mjs` now re-derives this from the templates and fails when
 * either list has drifted, so the next feature cannot reopen the same hole quietly.

 * Wait until a screen has stopped changing, or explain why it never did.
 *
 * ## Why a quiet window, and why it covers the drawer AND the host
 *
 * A scan that arrives mid-load does not just add noise, it can report the wrong number. The
 * drawer's folder tree showed that first: while a node loads, its toggle holds
 * `<mat-spinner aria-label="Loading">`, which lends the button an accessible name its settled
 * state does not have, so an early scan reported six unnamed toggles where there were seven
 * (`docs/accessibility.md`, "The run-to-run difference was a loading spinner masking a real
 * defect").
 *
 * The same shape recurs well beyond the tree, which is why this observes both regions:
 *
 *   - the drawer's other panels — favorites, recently viewed, expired, collections, tasks —
 *     each render their own `.tree-loading` **outside** `.folder-tree`, which the earlier
 *     tree-only wait never looked at;
 *   - those panels, and the result lists inside feature hosts, fetch thumbnails after the list
 *     renders and swap an icon for an `<img>` when each arrives, with no loading marker at all.
 *
 * The app exposes no "loaded" signal for any of this, so stillness is the evidence: no loader
 * visible, and the tree node count, `<img>` count and element count of both regions unchanged
 * for `quietMs`. All are read in one `evaluate`, so a poll sees one consistent DOM rather than
 * counts taken across a re-render.
 *
 * `<img>` is counted separately because an icon-to-thumbnail swap replaces one element with one
 * element and leaves the element count unchanged.
 *
 * Shared by the Playwright specs (through `waitForScreenSettled` in `fixtures.ts`) and the
 * Node diagnostics, so the two cannot disagree about when a screen is ready to measure.
 *
 * Not covered: a loading state with none of the markers in `LOADING_SELECTOR` — on
 * `/#/browse-adf-hx`, whatever upstream `hxp-document-tree` shows while it loads, if it is not
 * one of them. The element counts still have to hold still, so such a state is only missed if
 * it outlasts `quietMs` without the DOM changing.
