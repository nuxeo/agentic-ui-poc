/**
 * Route render probe — the negative control for every route an accessibility scan visits.
 *
 * An empty screen scans clean. That is the single most dangerous failure mode in this repository's
 * accessibility tooling, because it produces a **green result that means nothing**, and it has
 * already happened three times:
 *
 *   - `scripts/beta-harness/steps/phase-6-a11y.mjs` shipped a step labelled "Login surface" that
 *     actually scanned the
 *     dashboard, caught only because a selector assertion failed;
 *   - the same file's "browse cards" step scanned the table view, because the view mode is held in
 *     a service and survived navigation;
 *   - and it still scans `/#/collections`, which has **no matching route** — `collectionsRoutes`
 *     declares exactly one path, `:uid`, so the bare path renders nothing and the clean result is
 *     counted as a pass. That is `docs/accessibility.md` gap 5.
 *
 * Two of those were found by a selector assertion. The third was never caught because that step has
 * no selector assertion. This script is that assertion, applied uniformly to every route rather
 * than to whichever ones somebody remembered.
 *
 * It runs no axe and needs no scanner, so it is seconds rather than minutes and can be run before
 * any scan to establish that the scan will have something to look at.
 *
 * Prerequisites (version kept in sync with a11y/versions.mjs):
 *   npm install --no-save @playwright/test@1.63.0
 *   npm run beta:backend && npx nx serve nuxeo-ui
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node a11y/diagnostics/route-render-check.mjs
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 every route rendered, 1 at least one rendered nothing or only its error state,
 * 2 could not measure (a precondition failed, or any route could not be loaded and none rendered
 * nothing).
