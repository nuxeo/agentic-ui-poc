/**
 * The "could not measure" exit for the diagnostics.
 *
 * ## Why this is shared rather than inline
 *
 * `run.mjs` gives the three diagnostics `preflight: false` — they answer in seconds and
 * waiting on a Nuxeo document query would cost more than it buys. The bargain is that each
 * then checks its own preconditions and reports them as **exit 2**, the
 * `precondition-not-met` convention: fix the environment, do not iterate on the code.
 *
 * Each of them held up one half of that bargain. Importing `@playwright/test` was guarded;
 * *launching* the browser was not, and neither was the first navigation. A missing Chromium
 * therefore surfaced as an uncaught rejection — exit 1, with a stack trace — which reads as
 * "the diagnostic found a problem in the application" rather than "nothing measured anything".
 * Flagged in review on PR #225, and observed the same day: a shell exported
 * `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` pointing at an empty cache and `route-render-check` failed with
 * exit 1 as though the routes were broken.
 *
 * Exit 2 is not cosmetic here. `run.mjs` propagates it specifically so a caller can tell a
 * broken environment from a failing check, and flattening everything to 1 erases that.
