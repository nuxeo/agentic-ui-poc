/**
 * Negative control for a11y-scout's reflow scanner (WCAG 1.4.10).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Reflow is one of the three capabilities a11y-scout was adopted for, and across every report
 * on disk — 81 findings over seven routes, 71 over seven interaction states, 12 on login — it
 * has produced **zero** findings. That is either a clean bill of health or a scanner that
 * cannot fail, and this repository's rule is that the two are indistinguishable until you have
 * watched the check go red on purpose.
 *
 * ## What the scanner actually does, and why zero is plausible
 *
 * `node_modules/a11y-scout/src/scanners/reflow.ts` resizes to 320×256, reads
 * `documentElement.scrollWidth`, and — this is the part that matters here — attributes the
 * overflow. An element that overflows is ignored if it is inside one of:
 *
 *     table, pre, svg, [role="img"], [role="application"]
 *
 * which WCAG 1.4.10 exempts as "content that by usage requires two-dimensional layout". A
 * violation is reported only when at least one overflowing element sits OUTSIDE all of those.
 *
 * This application renders its primary surfaces as `mat-table`, which emits a real `<table>`.
 * So a zero is exactly what a correct scanner should return here, and the interesting question
 * is not "is the app clean" but "would this scanner notice if it were not".
 *
 * ## What this prints
 *
 * Per route: the 320px `scrollWidth`, whether anything overflows, and if so whether every
 * offender is inside an exempt subtree. The last column is the scanner's verdict reproduced
 * independently. A route that overflows via a NON-exempt element and was still reported clean
 * by a11y-scout would mean the scanner is broken.
 *
 * A row measured after closing the nav drawer says so. At 320px every route measured on
 * 2026-10-02 opened with the drawer filling the screen and the content 0px wide; see
 * `revealContentBehindDrawer`.
 *
 * Run:  node a11y/diagnostics/reflow-probe.mjs
