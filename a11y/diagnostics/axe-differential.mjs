/**
 * Differential axe harness — settles "The open disagreement" in `docs/accessibility.md`.
 *
 * a11y-scout's first baseline reported 8 `color-contrast` and 2 `button-name` findings.
 * `scripts/beta-harness/steps/phase-6-a11y.mjs` records both rules as driven to zero, with an
 * empty `KNOWN_VIOLATIONS`. Both cannot be right, and under the ownership standard phase-6 owns
 * the axe verdict — so if phase-6 is the one that is wrong, the published conformance number is
 * wrong with it.
 *
 * ## Hypotheses already eliminated without a browser, so this script does not re-test them
 *
 *   1. **Different axe versions.** `npm ls axe-core --all` resolves ONE deduped `axe-core@4.13.0`
 *      for both `@axe-core/playwright@4.13.0` and `a11y-scout@0.3.0`. Identical engine.
 *   2. **a11y-scout's reflow check resizing the viewport.** In `a11y-scout/src/agents/scan-page.ts`
 *      axe runs at line 121, reflow at 271 and the keyboard walk at 279 — axe runs FIRST, before
 *      anything resizes, and `reflow.ts:113` restores the original viewport regardless.
 *
 * ## What is left, and what this script varies
 *
 * Exactly two things differ between the harnesses, and this script isolates the first:
 *
 *   - **Tag set.** phase-6 passes `wcag2a, wcag2aa, wcag21a, wcag21aa`. a11y-scout at AA adds
 *     `wcag22a, wcag22aa, best-practice`. Both variants run here, back to back **in the same page
 *     visit**, so page state is identical and the tag list is the only variable.
 *   - **When each was measured.** phase-6's zero is dated 2026-08-24; the a11y-scout baseline is
 *     from 2026-09-11 against a tree with substantial uncommitted change. A rule that reproduces
 *     here under phase-6's own tags means phase-6's claim has gone stale, not that it was wrong.
 *
 * This is a **diagnostic, not a gate**. It exits 0 when it measured every requested surface,
 * including when it finds violations — the whole point is to report a number, and a diagnostic
 * that fails the build is one people stop running.
 *
 * It exits 2 when **any** requested surface could not be measured, not only when all of them
 * failed. A comparison drawn from a partial population is not a smaller result, it is a
 * misleading one: the phase-6 verdicts printed at the end would be computed over whichever
 * surfaces happened to render. A scan that silently did not happen must never read as clean.
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 *   npm install --no-save @playwright/test @axe-core/playwright
 *     ^ both in ONE command. `npm install --no-save X` prunes previously --no-save'd packages.
 *   npm run beta:backend && npx nx serve nuxeo-ui
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node a11y/diagnostics/axe-differential.mjs
 *   node a11y/diagnostics/axe-differential.mjs --surface browse --surface tasks
 *   node a11y/diagnostics/axe-differential.mjs --json out.json
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 measured, 2 could not measure.
