 * Refuse to run an accessibility scan against a stack that is not there.
 *
 * A scan of a page that did not render is clean, fast and worthless — the vacuous pass this
 * repository has been caught by repeatedly. Playwright's own behaviour when the dev server is
 * absent is a wall of navigation timeouts, which reads as product failures rather than as
 * "nothing was serving".
 *
 * Deliberately a sibling of `scripts/beta-harness/e2e-preflight.mjs` rather than a flag on it.
 * The critical-path suite needs Playwright and a live stack; this needs both a11y-scout
 * tarballs as well, and a missing tarball must cost the accessibility run and nothing else.
 * Keeping it here is also what lets `a11y/` be deleted without editing a shared script.
 *
 * Exits **2**, not 1 — the `precondition-not-met` convention `phase-runner.mjs` established:
 * fix the environment, do not iterate on the code.
