/**
 * Playwright configuration for the runtime accessibility suite.
 *
 * ## Why this whole folder is self-contained
 *
 * Everything this suite needs — specs, fixtures, config, diagnostics, tool docs and report
 * output — lives under `a11y/`, and nothing under `apps/` or `libs/` is modified to support
 * it. That is deliberate: this is development tooling with an expected end date, and the
 * removal procedure in `README.md` is `rm -rf a11y/`, one line of `package.json`, and an
 * edit to `docs/accessibility.md` — nothing in application code.
 *
 * It costs one thing, recorded here rather than discovered later: `installSession()` in
 * `./fixtures.ts` is a copy of the same function in `apps/nuxeo-ui-e2e/src/fixtures.ts`. A
 * shared import would have been one definition, but it would also have been a second reason
 * this folder cannot simply be deleted. The copy fails loudly — a changed session shape means
 * authentication fails and every `expect` in every spec goes red — so the drift is visible
 * rather than silent.
 *
 * ## Why it is not a project inside the critical-path config
 *
 * `apps/nuxeo-ui-e2e` needs only Playwright and a live stack. This needs both a11y-scout
 * tarballs, which are hand-distributed and resolvable from no registry, so collecting these
 * specs there would fail thirteen critical-path specs with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND on any
 * machine that has not downloaded them. Separate directory, separate config, no overlap —
 * which is also why the critical-path config needs no `testIgnore` for us.
 */

/**
 * Where the app is served — resolved by the same function the preflight and all three
 * diagnostics use, so every `a11y:scan` subcommand points at the same place.
 *
 * This config and the preflight previously read `E2E_BASE_URL` while the diagnostics read
 * `APP_URL`. Behind one entry point that meant either documented override sent some
 * subcommands at the requested deployment and left the rest on localhost, so a `surfaces`
 * run and a `reflow` run could describe two different applications and still be compared.

/**
 * Browser and context settings shared by every project below.
 *
 * Chromium only. WebKit would emit a second report with near-identical findings, because
 * axe's rule set is engine-independent and the keyboard walk drives the same DOM. Add a
 * WebKit project if a WebKit-specific accessibility question ever needs answering.
 *
 * Authentication needs **both** mechanisms and this was established the hard way: injecting a
 * session into `sessionStorage` satisfies the route guard so pages render, but does not
 * reliably authenticate XHRs, which surfaces as intermittent 403s on `/nuxeo/api` paths.
 * `httpCredentials` is the other half.
 *
 * Credentials are **required**, not defaulted — `requireNuxeoCredentials()` throws when either
 * variable is unset, so the config fails to load rather than scanning as a guessed identity.
 * Both halves read the same function, so they cannot diverge.
 *
 * Hoisted so every project shares it by reference — a new project cannot pick up a different
 * browser by copy-pasting the wrong line.

  // Playwright timeout **restarts the worker**, which recreates the worker-scoped a11y-scout
  // accumulator, so every surface scanned before it is dropped from the consolidated report.
  // That run reported `pages scanned: 1` after five successful scans. The
  // `pagesScanned.length` assertion is what made it visible rather than silent.
