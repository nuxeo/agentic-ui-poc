/**
 * The screens the accessibility journey covers — the single source of truth.
 *
 * Imported by **both** `journey.a11y.spec.ts` (which declares one test per screen) and
 * `playwright.a11y.config.ts` (which declares one project per screen). Adding a screen is one
 * edit here plus one `journeyTest()` call in the spec; nothing else needs touching, including
 * `package.json`, because `a11y:scan -- journey` selects projects with a `journey-*` wildcard.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists rather than three parallel lists
 *
 * Before it, a screen's identity was written out three times — a tag in the test title, a
 * `grep` regex in the config, and a project name — and nothing tied them together. That is a
 * silent failure, not a noisy one, and it was measured rather than assumed:
 *
 *     a fifth project declared with grep /@journey-serach/ (a typo for "search")
 *     → Total: 4 tests in 1 file        exit: 0
 *
 * Playwright reports "No tests found" only when the *whole run* is empty. A single project
 * matching nothing, alongside projects that match, is dropped without a warning — so a screen
 * added with a mistyped tag would simply never be scanned while the command stayed green.
 *
 * Two mechanisms close that, and between them every way of getting it wrong is loud:
 *
 *   - `JourneyScreenId` is a literal union, so `journeyTag('logn')` is a **compile error**;
 *   - the spec asserts at module scope that every id in `JOURNEY_SCREENS` was declared, so an
 *     id added here with no matching test is a **collection error** in every project.
 */
