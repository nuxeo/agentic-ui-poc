/**
 * WCAG 2.1 AA scan of the **user journey**, one self-contained report per screen.
 *
 * ## What this adds over the suites that already exist
 *
 * `surfaces.a11y.spec.ts` scans seven authenticated routes into ONE consolidated report, and
 * `interaction-states.a11y.spec.ts` scans seven states behind clicks into another. Both group
 * their output by WCAG rule, which answers "which rules does this app fail" but not "how bad
 * is the screen I am about to demo". This file answers the second question: it walks the
 * screens in the order a real user meets them and emits a separate report for each, so a
 * screen can be handed to whoever owns it without them reading around six other screens.
 *
 * Most screens below are scanned here and by nothing else:
 *
 *   - **login** — no committed script has ever scanned it. It was covered once by an ad-hoc
 *     `a11y-scout scan-url` against a backend-less dev server, which is not the same page:
 *     that run saw the form in its error state.
 *   - **dashboard** — `app.routes.ts` redirects `path: ''` here, so it is the first screen
 *     every signed-in user sees, and it is absent from `SURFACES`.
 *   - **document detail** — the most-used read surface in the product.
 *   - **search with a query, documents, a collection, personal space** — routed screens with
 *     real result lists, none in `SURFACES` except `/#/search`, which that suite scans with no
 *     query applied.
 *   - **favorites, recently viewed, clipboard, expired queue** — these routes render a
 *     "Coming soon" placeholder; the screen is the nav-drawer panel that a deep link opens.
 *     Other suites see the drawer only as it is on their own routes — the folder tree on
 *     browse, the tasks panel on tasks — so these four panels are scanned here and nowhere else.
 *
 * Tasks, trash and administration are in `SURFACES` too, but there with only the general
 * `expectSurfaceUsable` check. How strongly each screen here is tied to real content varies,
 * and each test says which applies:
 *
 *   - **its own data request succeeded, and the first entry it returned is on screen** —
 *     search, documents, collection, favorites, recently viewed, trash, and the expired queue
 *     when it has entries. See `captureDataRequest`. On search, documents and trash the drawer
 *     makes the same kind of request, and every one of them must succeed — see
 *     `captureEveryDataRequest`.
 *   - **its own data request succeeded, and the screen that follows from it is shown** — tasks
 *     (the first task's form, or the empty inbox; the drawer's identical request must succeed
 *     too), personal space (the redirect to the path the server returned) and administration
 *     (the request succeeded; the landing tab shows no repository data to check against).
 *   - **a named document is on screen, from a separate repository query** — document detail,
 *     and clipboard, whose content is seeded in the browser rather than requested.
 *   - **the screen rendered without an error state** — login, dashboard and browse, which have
 *     no single piece of data guaranteed to be present.
 *
 * ## Why one Playwright project per screen, rather than one `generateReport()` call each
 *
 * The a11y-scout accumulator is **worker-scoped**, and `finalizeAndEmit` does not clear
 * `pageScans` when it emits — it only flips `reportEmitted`. Calling `generateReport()` once
 * per screen inside a single worker would therefore produce cumulative reports: login, then
 * login+dashboard, then login+dashboard+browse. Each would be labelled with one screen and
 * contain several, which is precisely the kind of self-confirming artifact this repository
 * has been bitten by before.
 *
 * A Playwright project gets its own worker, so `../playwright.config.ts` declares one
 * project per screen and each accumulates and emits independently. `emitScreenReport()`
 * asserts `pagesScanned.length === 1` so that if this assumption ever stops holding — a
 * Playwright change, a fixture change — the run goes red instead of quietly emitting a
 * report that covers more than its title claims.
 *

 * the search page sets an `error` signal its template never renders, and the favorites and
 * collections panels have no error state at all — a failed request on any of them renders as

 * request the screen itself made, and requiring it to succeed, closes that.
 *
 * The listener is registered before navigating, so a response that arrives during the
 * navigation is not missed. A navigation that fails is reported as that, not as a missing
 * request — the two have different causes and a shared message sent people after the wrong one.
 *
 * Only for a request no other component on the screen makes. Where another one does, the
 * first match may be the wrong one, and the other's failure goes unseen: use

 * so `authGuard` bounces `/` to `/#/login` — does not work here, and the first run of this
 * file failed on exactly that:
 *
 *     Expected pattern: /#\/login/
 *     Received string:  "http://localhost:4200/#/dashboard"
 *
 * With no stored session, `runHydration()` falls through to `tryEstablishCookieSessionOnly()`,
 * which GETs `/nuxeo/api/v1/me`. The base config sets `httpCredentials` for the app origin,
 * so Playwright answers that request's Basic auth challenge automatically, `/me` returns a
 * user, the app builds a cookie session, and the guard lets it through to the dashboard.
 * "No session injected" is therefore not the same as "signed out" — the browser signs itself
 * in on the app's behalf.
 *
 * That failure is the reason this test asserts the URL before scanning. Without it the scan
 * would have run on the dashboard and emitted a report titled `journey-01-login` containing
 * dashboard findings, which is the vacuous pass `phase-6-a11y.mjs` shipped once already.
 *
 * ## The two mechanisms used instead, and what each is for
 *
 *   - `httpCredentials: undefined` on this project (see `../playwright.config.ts`) removes
 *     the automatic Basic auth, so the browser genuinely has no credentials to offer.
 *   - The signed-out marker makes hydration short-circuit before it probes the server at all,
 *     so the screen does not depend on how the server answers an anonymous `/me`.
 *
 * Both are setup, not verification. The `toHaveURL` and `toBeVisible` assertions below are
 * what actually prove the sign-in form is on screen, and they have already been seen to fail.

 * ## Why the query is a quick filter and not typed text
 *
 * The obvious query — text in the drawer's Full Text box — cannot be scanned on a stock
 * server, and finding that out is the reason this comment exists. The page sends it as
 * `ecm_fulltext`, and Nuxeo answers **400 "Fulltext search disabled by configuration"** when
 * full-text search is not enabled, which is the default. The search page renders that failure
 * as an empty result list (it sets an `error` signal its template never shows), so a typed
 * query would have scanned an empty page under the label "search results". The drawer's
 * facet filters are no alternative on the same server: they are built from aggregations, and
 * `default_search` returns none.
 *
 * What does narrow the query everywhere is the URL: the "No Containers" quick filter and a
 * sort. It is a real query — on the instance this was written against it took 59 results to
 * 44 — and it is the state a shared or bookmarked search link opens in.
