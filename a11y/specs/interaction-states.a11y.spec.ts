/**
 * WCAG 2.1 AA scan of **interaction states** — surfaces that exist only after a click.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * `surfaces.a11y.spec.ts` and `phase-6-a11y.mjs` both navigate to a route, wait, and scan.
 * Between them they cover the default, freshly-loaded state of eight routes and nothing else.
 * Every dialog, overlay, secondary tab and alternate view mode in this application has never
 * been looked at by any layer.
 *
 * That is not a theoretical gap. Two measurements say it is where the findings are:
 *
 *   - When `phase-6-a11y.mjs` widened from three surfaces to fifteen cases, the rule classes
 *     found went from four to seven. Three of the extra classes were reachable only in states
 *     a single visit per route never produces — a 3.54:1 contrast failure on `.card-type` was
 *     invisible until a step clicked "Card view".
 *   - `/#/browse` alone declares **four** `mat-tab`s (View, Permissions, History, Trash) and
 *     opens **thirteen** dialogs. Only the View tab has ever been scanned, so three whole tabs
 *     of form fields and tables are unmeasured on a route we already call covered.
 *
 * ## Why each state is scanned at the same URL, and how findings stay attributable
 *
 * The app uses hash routing and these states do not change the hash, so all seven scans below
 * report `pageUrl` as `.../#/browse`. The consolidated HTML report therefore cannot tell you
 * which click produced which finding. `scanPage()` returns the slice for that call alone, so
 * this file keeps its own per-state tally and prints it at the end. Read that table, not the
 * report's page grouping, when deciding what to fix.
 *
 * ## Why this is a separate Playwright project
 *
 * The a11y-scout accumulator is a **worker-scoped** fixture, so two spec files sharing a worker
 * share one report — and `surfaces.a11y.spec.ts` asserts its report covers exactly its own
 * surfaces, which a second file appending to the same accumulator would break. Projects get
 * their own workers, so `../playwright.config.ts` declares `surfaces` and `interaction-states`
 * separately and each emits its own report.
 *
 * Run:
 *   npm run a11y:scan -- states
