/**
 * Applies Layer 0 theme tokens to `<html>`, so a rebrand is a JSON edit.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * Without it, the `themes` and `defaultThemeId` keys in `bootstrap.json` are
 * **inert**. The first cut of this template shipped both keys and a comment
 * claiming "a rebrand needs no rebuild", while nothing read them — config that
 * looks live and does nothing, which is worse than config that is absent.
 *
 * ## Why an `effect` rather than a one-shot call
 *
 * `AppConfigService.load()` is asynchronous, and `bootstrap()` is a signal that
 * starts on the packaged defaults. Applying tokens once at construction would
 * capture the defaults and never see the deployed file. The product's
 * `AppThemeService` has the same shape for the same reason.
 *
 * ## What it does not do
 *
 * It writes CSS custom properties only. It does not switch a compiled Material
 * palette — those come from Sass mixins and cannot be changed from JSON, which
 * is why `AppThemeConfig.base` exists in the product and is ignored here. A fork
 * that adds Material should read `base` and set `data-app-theme` too.
