/**
 * Assert that no test-only library, and no `eval()`, reaches the production bundle.
 *
 * Phase 3's spike measured what happens when `@alfresco/adf-core` and
 * `@alfresco/adf-hx-content-services` are installed as published: adf-hx imports
 * `ng-mocks` — a test-mocking library — from its **shipped** `/ui` runtime bundle, so
 * ng-mocks' implementation landed in a 1.6 MB customer-facing chunk carrying two
 * `eval()` calls. For an on-premises enterprise product that fails CSP and every SAST
 * review. `tools/stubs/ng-mocks/` replaces it, permanently — upstream will not be
 * changing this — and this is the check that the replacement is actually working.
 *
 * Because the stub is indefinite, this gate is too. A future adf-hx release could import
 * a different test helper, which shows up here as a new fingerprint going red rather
 * than as a silent regression.
 *
 * It reads the built bytes rather than `package.json`, because the question is not
 * what we declared, it is what a customer receives. A stub that stops working, an
 * `npm install` that quietly restores the real library, or a new upstream version
 * that imports a different test helper all show up here and nowhere else.
 *
 * `eval` is matched as a call — `eval(` — rather than as a word, so the string "eval"
 * inside an unrelated identifier or a sourcemap comment does not fail the gate.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/no-test-libs-in-bundle.mjs [dist-dir]
 *
 * Exit 1 if a banned symbol is present, or if there is no build to inspect — a check
 * that inspected nothing is not a pass.
