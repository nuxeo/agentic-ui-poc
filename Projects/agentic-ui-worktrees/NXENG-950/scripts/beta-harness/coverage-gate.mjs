/**
 * Coverage ratchet gate.
 *
 * The Beta quality bar is >90% unit coverage. Nothing here is near that — the
 * adf-hx bridge has 11 tests for 2,949 lines — so a gate set at 90% would be red
 * on every run from now until Phase 6, and a gate that cannot pass gets bypassed
 * and then ignored. That is worse than no gate.
 *
 * So this ratchets instead. It records where each project is today and fails when
 * a project goes **backwards**. Coverage can only improve, and the report says how
 * far each project still is from the 90% target, so the debt stays visible rather
 * than becoming a number nobody looks at until Phase 6.
 *
 * It summarises `coverage-final.json`, which the default Vitest reporters already
 * write, rather than requiring `json-summary` — Nx swallows `--coverage.reporter`,
 * and adding it to seventeen vite configs to satisfy one script is the wrong trade.
 *
 * ## Three states, not two
 *
 * A project is **measured**, or it is **unmeasurable** — a coverage report that measures
 * nothing. The distinction is the whole point of the 2026-08-24 fix: `0/0` statements scored
 * as `100%`, so `assets` and `tasks`, which have no spec files at all, were recorded in the
 * baseline as meeting the Beta bar. That inflated count reached the plan, the delivery record
 * and a leadership page as "5 of 17 projects meet 90%" when the true figure was 3.
 *
 * Unmeasurable is neither a pass nor a fail: it is *untested*. A baseline entry for one
 * **fails** this gate, because the entry is itself the defect.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/coverage-gate.mjs                    # check the ratchet
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/coverage-gate.mjs --update-baseline  # re-record after a rise
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/coverage-gate.mjs --run              # run the tests first
 *   node scripts/beta-harness/coverage-gate.mjs --json
 *
 * Exit 1 if any project's line coverage dropped by more than the tolerance, or if
 * --update-baseline is needed and has not been given.

 *    reaches is not reported as 0% — it is missing entirely.
 * 2. **Present with an empty statement map.** The report lists the file and records no statements
 *    at all. `search-filters-drawer.component.ts` is 1303 lines with ~465 executable lines and
 *    appears this way; the `search` project therefore reported 56.49% over 848 statements while
 *    its largest component contributed nothing to either side of that fraction.
 *
 * Only case 1 was checked before. Case 2 passed every check: the file IS in the report, so the
 * absent-file test is satisfied, and the project has plenty of statements, so the project-level
 * `sTotal === 0` vacuous test is satisfied too. Repo-wide, case 2 hides **67 files with
 * executable code** — including inside `shared-extensions` (96.04%) and `permission-dialogs`
 * (93.85%), two of the five projects counted as meeting the Beta bar.
 *
 * The cause differs between the two; the consequence does not. Untested code is invisible rather
 * than failing, so both are reported the same way and allowlisted the same way.
 *
 * ## The `noStatements` category
 *
 * 63 zero-statement files legitimately have none — pure type declarations, `export *` barrels,
 * constant tables. Those cannot be "tested" and a dated deadline for them would be a lie, so they
 * get a permanent exemption in a separate list. It is self-policing: if such a file ever gains a
