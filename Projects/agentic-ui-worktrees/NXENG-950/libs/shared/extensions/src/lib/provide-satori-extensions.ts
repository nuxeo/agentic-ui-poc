 * imperative calls against four registries: a customer should not have to know
 * that slots, rules, components and handlers live in different services, nor
 * which of them must be touched before the first slot resolves.
 *

 *     provideSatoriExtensions(PACKAGED_CONTRIBUTIONS),
 *     provideSatoriExtensions(() => ({

 * });

 *
 * ## Ordering, which is the reason this is a provider and not a service call
 *
 * Contributions are applied in an **environment initializer**, so every id is
 * registered before the first component resolves a slot. Registering from a
 * component constructor instead leaves a window in which a rule id is unknown,
 * and an unknown rule fails open — which is how the Administration nav entry
 * came to flash for a non-administrator. An environment initializer runs earlier
 * than `APP_INITIALIZER`, so it closes that window rather than narrowing it.
 *
 * Multiple calls **layer** in provider order, and later wins per id, which is
 * what makes a customer layer able to override a packaged rule, component or
 * handler. Slot descriptors accumulate rather than replace; use the manifest's
 * `overrides` to hide or reorder a packaged entry.
 *
 * Returns `EnvironmentProviders`, so it cannot be mistakenly listed in a
 * component's `providers` — where it would run too late to be worth anything.
