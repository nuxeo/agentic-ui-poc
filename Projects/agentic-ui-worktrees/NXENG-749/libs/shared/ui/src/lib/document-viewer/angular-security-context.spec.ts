/**
 * Pins Angular's DOM security context for the media bindings this repository cares about, by
 * observation rather than by assertion in prose.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * The claim "`source[src]`, `audio[src]` and `video[poster]` are `SecurityContext.NONE`, so a
 * `Safe*` value bound there stringifies" underpins `DocumentViewerComponent.rawBlobUrl`, the
 * `NONE_CONTEXT_BINDINGS` list in `scripts/beta-harness/sanitizer-audit.mjs`, and six binding fixes
 * in this PR. It was challenged in review as a premise Angular does not support — the counter-claim
 * being that these are URL contexts where a `SafeResourceUrl` is accepted and unwrapped.
 *
 * Prose cannot settle that and neither can reading the framework source, because both sides were
 * quoting it. So this renders a **real** `DomSanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl` value into
 * each binding and reads the attribute back out of the DOM. If a future Angular version changes the
 * schema, this file fails and says which binding moved — which is the only way the claim stays true
 * rather than merely repeated.
 *
 * ## What it found
 *
 * The three NONE bindings stringify. `video[src]`, `img[src]` and `a[href]` do not: Angular registers
 * those as `SecurityContext.URL`, and `allowSanitizationBypassAndThrow` deliberately admits a
 * ResourceURL in a URL context ("they are strictly more trusted"). Both halves matter — the second is
 * why `video[src]` is correctly *absent* from `NONE_CONTEXT_BINDINGS`, and why the audit is not simply
 * "every media attribute is NONE".
