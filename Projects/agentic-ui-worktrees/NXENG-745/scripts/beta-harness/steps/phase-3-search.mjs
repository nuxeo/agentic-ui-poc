/**
 * Phase 3 — the one thing its evidence never covered: search, against live Nuxeo.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists separately
 *
 * `phase-3-adf-hx.mjs` has fifteen steps and none of them touches search. The phase's
 * own record says so in as many words: *"SEARCH IS STILL NOT VERIFIED AGAINST LIVE
 * NUXEO. The port is now correct at the wire — the generated NXQL is asserted — but no
 * evidence run drives the /#/search-adf-hx page against the real instance, so result
 * rendering, paging and the empty state are unproven."* That is why the phase is
 * recorded `in-progress` rather than complete, and this closes it.
 *
 * A separate file rather than fifteen more steps in an already 736-line one: this
 * covers a distinct claim and can be re-run on its own in seconds.
 *
 * ## Which checks are load-bearing
 *
 * - Step 2 is the phase's actual gap: a full-text term returns **real Nuxeo documents
 *   with titles that came from the repository**, cross-checked against what the REST
 *   API returns for the same term. Asserting "some rows rendered" would pass against
 *   any list, so the titles are compared.
 * - Step 4 is the empty state. A search UI that renders nothing for a nonsense term
 *   looks identical to one that is broken, so the empty state is asserted explicitly.
 * - Step 5 is paging. The register notes paging was only ever unit-tested; this drives
 *   the control and asserts the page indicator moves.
 *
 * - Step 3 is **negative**: it re-runs the same query and checks the count is stable.
 *   It would also pass if search were returning a constant, which is why step 2 does
 *   the work.
 *
 * ## The known flakiness, handled rather than ignored
 *
 * `phase-3-adf-hx.mjs` avoids NXQL search deliberately, because it is OpenSearch-backed
 * here and lags a check-in by seconds. So this file does not create content: it queries
 * the REST API first for a term, and only asserts the UI against terms the index has
 * already settled on. If the index has nothing, it aborts as a precondition rather than
 * reporting a failure that is really an environment.
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 *   docker start nuxeo
 *   npx nx serve nuxeo-ui
 *   npm run beta:evidence -- phase-3-search
