/**
 * Phase 4 — Layer 2: publishable platform.
 *
 * The claim: **the platform is an installable package, a customer can fork the
 * template and extend it from their own library, and none of that requires editing
 * our code.**
 *
 * ## This phase is not like the others, and the evidence reflects that
 *
 * Phases 0-3 assert things about the product UI. Phase 4 asserts things about an
 * **npm artifact** and a **fork**, so a Playwright run against the product dev
 * server would prove nothing about it. This runs against the **built template**
 * served statically, and pairs the browser observations with assertions read
 * directly out of `dist/libs/platform` — the bytes a customer installs.
 *
 * ## Which checks are load-bearing, and which are not
 *
 * Read the total as a mixture, not as a count of equally meaningful facts.
 *
 * **Load-bearing** — each fails if the thing it names is not actually working:
 *
 * - Step 2: Layer 0 branding reaches both the DOM and `document.title`. The title
 *   half matters specifically: it was broken for a commit because
 *   `provideAppInitializer` callbacks run *concurrently*, so it read the config
 *   before `load()` resolved and rendered the packaged default while the heading
 *   beside it showed the configured brand.
 * - Step 3: a Layer 0 theme token is written to `<html>` **and consumed**. The
 *   computed nav background is compared against the packaged default, so a token
 *   that is written but ignored by the CSS still fails. Before `TemplateThemeService`
 *   existed, `themes` and `defaultThemeId` were present in `bootstrap.json` and
 *   entirely inert — this is the check that would have caught it.
 * - Step 4: nav text still contrasts with the themed nav background. A rebrand must
 *   not be able to make navigation unreadable from JSON alone.
 * - Step 5: the navbar is resolved **from the registry**, asserted by exact id set.
 * - Step 6: the **generated** extension library's nav entry renders, which is the
 *   zero-edit Layer 2 claim observed rather than asserted. `libs/extensions/acme-extensions`
 *   was produced by the generator and integrated by one line in the template's
 *   `app.config.ts`; if registration were inert, this entry would be absent.
 * - Step 7: `inventory()` lists the generated library's rule and nav ids.
 * - Step 9: the published `.d.ts` carries nullable types. A direct regression guard
 *   for the defect where the package was compiled without `strictNullChecks` and
 *   shipped 27 wrongly non-nullable public types.
 * - Step 10: the `exports` map advertises five entry points and every `types` file
 *   it names exists. An entry pointing at a missing file is an unresolvable import
 *   for a customer, which is how `ng-packagr-lite` shipped four broken subpaths.
 * - Step 11: `private: true` survives into the built artifact, so an accidental
 *   `npm publish` is refused while the scope is unconfirmed (R10).
 *
 * **Negative / fallback** — regression guards that would also pass if parts of the
 * system were inert:
 *
 * - Step 8: the diagnostics panel reports the Layer 1 manifest falling back to
 *   packaged defaults. The template ships no Nuxeo server, so this is the *expected*
 *   path; it proves the fallback is reported honestly, not that the manifest works.
 * - Step 12: no unexpected console errors. The manifest 404 is expected and excluded
 *   by URL, so this cannot quietly absorb it.
 *
 * That is 9 load-bearing steps and 2 negative ones.
 *
 * ## What this phase's evidence deliberately does not cover
 *
 * - **Peer installability.** Nothing here resolves the ten declared peers from a
 *   registry at the versions we declare. `fork-simulation` compiles against the
 *   built declarations offline; it says nothing about whether `npm install`
 *   succeeds. Recorded as a note, not a check.
 * - **The Layer 1 manifest doing real work in the template.** There is no Nuxeo
 *   server, so `overrides` and manifest-added slots are unexercised here. Phase 2's
 *   evidence covers that mechanism against the product.
 *
 * Prerequisites — no Nuxeo needed, unlike every other phase:
 *   npx nx build platform
 *   npx nx build nuxeo-satori-template
 *   npx http-server dist/nuxeo-satori-template/browser -p 4321 -s
 *   APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4321 npm run beta:evidence -- phase-4-platform
