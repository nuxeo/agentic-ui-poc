/**
 * Phase 6 — WCAG 2.1 AA for the Beta slice.
 *
 * The Beta quality bar includes WCAG 2.1 AA (`docs/adf-hx-beta-plan.md`, Phase 6) and nothing had
 * ever measured it. The first version of this file established the baseline; this version asserts
 * the bar is **met**.
 *
 * ## What changed on 2026-08-24, and why the ratchet is gone
 *
 * The baseline version scanned **three** surfaces and ratcheted **four** rule ids. Widening the
 * scan to fifteen cases showed that both numbers were understatements: there were **seven** rule
 * classes and 77 violating nodes, and three of the extra ones were on surfaces this file never
 * visited. A ratchet over an under-sampled scan reports "no new violations" while the violations it
 * cannot see accumulate — the same failure mode as a gate that has never been seen to go red.
 *
 * All of it is now fixed, so `KNOWN_VIOLATIONS` is **empty** and the verdict is unconditional:
 *
 * | Rule                          | Was | Now | Owner                                    |
 * | ----------------------------- | --- | --- | ---------------------------------------- |
 * | `button-name`                 | 21  |  0  | ours                                     |
 * | `label`                       | 42  |  0  | ours                                     |
 * | `role-img-alt`                | 12  |  0  | ours                                     |
 * | `nested-interactive`          | 40  |  0  | ours                                     |
 * | `color-contrast`              |  7  |  0  | ours                                     |
 * | `scrollable-region-focusable` |  2  |  0  | ours                                     |
 * | `aria-progressbar-name`       |  2  |  0  | ours                                     |
 * | `aria-required-children`      |  3  |  3  | **`@alfresco/adf-core@9.0.0`** — see below |
 *
 * ## The one exclusion, and why it is scoped to a single step
 *
 * `aria-required-children` is excluded on the **adf-hx POC surface only**. It is upstream's defect:
 * `DataTableComponent` emits `role="row"` whose direct children are plain divs and a bare
 * `mat-checkbox`, which the `row` role does not permit. Reported in full, with the template quoted,
 * as finding **1.2** in `docs/adf-hx-upstream-findings.md`.
 *
 * The only host-side fix is to patch `role` attributes onto another library's DOM after render, so
 * it is excluded rather than papered over — and excluded on **one step**, not globally, so the same
 * rule failing on a surface we own still fails this capture. A repo-wide `ignore` list would have
 * hidden exactly that.
 *
 * ## What this capture does and does not cover
 *
 * Fifteen cases: eight routes, plus view-mode and column-panel states that a single visit per route
 * does not reach. Three of the seven rule classes were only visible in those extra states.
 *
 * The **login surface is still not covered**, and that is a harness limitation rather than a choice:
 * the runner sets `httpCredentials`, so the app authenticates before the login page can render. The
 * first draft of this file labelled a step "Login surface" and actually scanned the dashboard — a
 * test defect, caught by the selector assertion failing rather than by the scan. `phase-0-no-backend`
 * is the only file that sees login, and only because authentication fails there.
 *
 * Also not covered: dialogs, the upload flow, and dark mode. Stated rather than implied, because
 * "WCAG 2.1 AA met" is a claim whose scope is the thing that makes it true or false.
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 *   npm install --no-save @playwright/test @axe-core/playwright
 *     ^ both in ONE command. `npm install --no-save X` prunes previously --no-save'd packages,
 *       so installing axe alone silently removes Playwright.
 *   npm run beta:backend
 *   npx nx serve nuxeo-ui
 *
 * Run:
 *   npm run beta:evidence -- phase-6-a11y
