/**
 * Phase 5 — Layer 3: the agent harness a customer receives.
 *
 * The claim: **a customer gets generators that produce live registrations, the contract
 * and the procedure inside the package, and a guardrail that catches their mistakes.**
 *
 * ## Why this run is mostly not a browser
 *
 * Phase 5's deliverables are generators, shipped documents and a script. Three of the
 * four are filesystem facts, so most checks read the built package and the generated
 * library rather than the DOM — the same shape Phase 4 used, and for the same reason:
 * a Playwright run against a UI would prove nothing about any of it.
 *
 * The one thing that *must* be observed in a browser is that a generated contribution
 * actually reaches the screen. `libs/extensions/acme-extensions` was produced by the
 * generators and is wired into the template, so its navigation entry rendering is the
 * end-to-end proof that the generators register live code.
 *
 * ## Which checks are load-bearing
 *
 * - Step 2: the generated library's entry **renders**, and following it lands on its own
 *   panel. This is the check that would have caught the defect the generators shipped
 *   with, where every registration was spliced inside a comment: lint, typecheck and six
 *   specs all passed while nothing was registered.
 * - Step 3: the package ships the contract and the procedure, and the shipped contract
 *   is **byte-identical** to the one `beta:reference` gates. A copy that drifts is worse
 *   than no copy.
 * - Step 4: the customer guardrail catches all five of its failures, each driven against
 *   a mutated copy of the real library. A tool we hand customers and never exercise is
 *   one we would discover was broken from their CI log.
 * - Step 5: the four generators are registered and resolvable.
 *
 * - Step 6 is **negative**: it asserts the internal harness is unchanged. It would also
 *   pass if Phase 5 had done nothing at all, so read it as a non-interference guard
 *   rather than as evidence of delivery.
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 *   npx nx build platform            (so the shipped docs exist)
 *   npx nx build nuxeo-satori-template
 *   node -e "import('./tools/video/mock-customer/serve-app.mjs').then(m =>
 *     m.serveAppWithNuxeoProxy({ root: 'dist/nuxeo-satori-template/browser', port: 4322 }))"
 *   APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4322 npm run beta:evidence -- phase-5-harness
 *
 * A plain static server is NOT enough: the template's navigation is rule-gated on a
 * real Nuxeo session, and the stock Nuxeo image sends no CORS headers, so the bundle
 * must be served from the same origin as `/nuxeo`.
